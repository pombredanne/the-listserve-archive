title: The Listserve Archive
---

This site is an automatic archive of the daily posts from [The Listserve](http://www.thelistserve.com), an email lottery. This is an unsanctioned effort; head to their site to see what it's all about.

This site is hosted on [Simon Weber](http://www.simonmweber.com)'s [GitHub](https://github.com/simon-weber/the-listserve-archive). A simple backend receives emails, then formats and commits them to the repo. The repo is automatically served with GitHub Pages. Contributions are welcome.

All posts are licensed under the [Creative Commons 3](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

There are no plans to serve an atom/rss feed of the posts; get on [The Listserve](http://www.thelistserve.com) so you have a chance to author one!
