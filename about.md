title: The Listserve Archive
---

Hi, I'm [Simon](http://www.simonmweber.com).
I didn't want any posts sent to [The Listserve](http://www.thelistserve.com) to be lost, so I built this site:
it's an unofficial, automatic archive.

If you find it to be useful, I'd really appreciate it if you [tipped me a buck on Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/simon-weber/).

The site is basically just a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/simon-weber/the-listserve-archive).
The backend formats and commits posts to the repo, which is automatically served with GitHub Pages.
Contributions are appreciated!

If you're interested in machine-friendly data, see the [data directory](https://github.com/simon-weber/the-listserve-archive/tree/gh-pages/data).
You can get this by cloning the repo, or through http (eg [http://thelistservearchive.com/data/2013-01-01.json](http://thelistservearchive.com/data/2013-01-01.json)).
