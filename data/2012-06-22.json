["[The Listserve] Just Do It", "Phil Crumm", "That idea you have? Stop putting it off. Will it be difficult? Probably. Will you want to give up? Absolutely. But don\u2019t. You have to persevere.\r\n\r\nWhat about failure? Learn from it. Try again. Be smarter this time. Make new mistakes. There\u2019s a story I heard once: it took Edison more than 1,000 tries to invent the light bulb. He remarked to a reporter that he had not failed, he had simply found 1,000 ways to not create a light bulb.\r\n\r\nHow about luck? You\u2019ll need it. But don\u2019t let that stop you. You can\u2019t get lucky if you don\u2019t even try.\r\n\r\nGet started. Change something. Do something.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhil Crumm\r\nme@philcrumm.com\r\nLos Angeles, California\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 22]]
