["[The Listserve] If", "Ming Min Hui", "I used to read a lot of poetry and want to get back into the habit of it. Below is a poem by Rudyard Kipling that I'd like to share with all of you, and I'd like to ask you to email me a poem or two back in response. I look forward to reading them.\r\n\r\nIf--\r\nBy Rudyard Kipling\r\n\r\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\r\n    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\r\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\r\n    But make allowance for their doubting too;\r\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\r\n    Or being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies,\r\nOr being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating,\r\n    And yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise:\r\n\r\nIf you can dream\u2014and not make dreams your master;\r\n    If you can think\u2014and not make thoughts your aim;\r\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\r\n    And treat those two impostors just the same;\r\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken\r\n    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\r\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\r\n    And stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools:\r\n\r\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\r\n    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\r\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\r\n    And never breathe a word about your loss;\r\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\r\n    To serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\r\n    Except the Will which says to them: \u2018Hold on!\u2019\r\n\r\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\r\n    Or walk with Kings\u2014nor lose the common touch,\r\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\r\n    If all men count with you, but none too much;\r\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\r\n    With sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run,\r\nYours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it,\r\n    And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a Man, my son!\r\n\r\n\r\nMing Min Hui\t\r\nmingminhui@gmail.com\t\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 27]]
