["[The Listserve] Would I Be A Different Person If I Had A Sibling?", "Yisha Zhang", "I won The ListServe Lottery, not on April Fool\u2019s Day, but on National Sibling Day, as an only child.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in China, a country known for a lot of things, including the \u201cone child policy.\u201d More than half of the people started to ask about the \u201cone child policy\u201d right after they knew I was born in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you guys still have that policy?\r\n\r\nWhy did your country have that policy?\r\n\r\nDoes China really have a large population? How large is it?\r\n\r\nBut I heard that people still had more than one child, right?\r\n\r\nBlah blah blah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, we did have that policy, because we did have and still have a large population. It\u2019s very large.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 1/5 of the world\u2019s population.\r\n\r\nRight now if two only child get married, they could have two kids.\r\n\r\nJust two.\r\n\r\nNo more than two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, what I want to talk about today, isn\u2019t that policy, but a question that has been lingering in my head \u2014 how different would I be, if I had a sibling or two?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently at work, we interviewed a lot of people for a project. A young women in her late twenties said that her little sister, who\u2019s now nine-year-old, is like her baby before she has her own baby. She would tell her all the lessons that she\u2019d learned in life to prevent her from making the same mistakes. And her biggest wish is for her little sister to grow into a happy and healthy young lady.\r\n\r\nI was so moved. I never had that kind of feeling. I never loved anyone in this world unselfishly and unconditionally other than my mom and dad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI never had a big sister who could have warned me not to fall for Mr. Wrong;\r\n\r\nI never had a big brother who could have taught me how to pitch, how to dance, and how to explore the world;\r\n\r\nI never had a little sister with whom I could have shared every little secret and every pretty dress;\r\n\r\nI never had a little brother whom I\u2019d call dumb and obnoxious all day long but be secretly proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA \u201cmean\u201d friend of mine always says that because I\u2019m the only child, I\u2019m spoiled. I\u2019m eager to win and I always want everything.\r\n\r\nBut I disagree. Because I was given everything growing up, I cannot care less about monetary things and thus find myself less competitive in a lot of situations.\r\n\r\nI cannot prove he\u2019s wrong, nor prove I\u2019m right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had a sibling\u2026\r\n\r\nWould I be tougher? Would I be stronger? Would I be kinder?\r\n\r\nWould I be more considerate? Would I be more patient? Would I be more mature?\r\n\r\nHow would they shape me and help me become someone different and better?\r\n\r\nI now live a Pacific away from my parents. If I had a sibling, would him or her move here to be closer to me? Would we be each other\u2019s support?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know. And I will never know.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not like, I\u2019ve never had a true adventure so I\u2019m ready to take a true adventure;\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not like, I\u2019ve never fallen onto the cold, hard ground so I\u2019m ready to take the biggest chance.\r\n\r\nI could never go back in time and grow up once again with a sibling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't be greedy with your love for your siblings, coz there are people longing to have one.\r\n\r\n\r\nYisha Zhang\r\nLA, CA, USA\r\n@yishazhang\r\nyisha.thelistserve@gmail.com\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 15]]
