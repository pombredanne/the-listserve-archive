["[The Listserve] Sport", "Peter Clarke", "I\u2019ve come very late to sport, having spent most of my life actively avoiding either watching or taking part in it.\r\n\r\nThis recent interest is a surprising development and so I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time pondering what it is about sport that appeals to me. I think it\u2019s the possibility of transcendence - that none of us really know what we can achieve when pushed but that, in sport, sometimes we get to find out.\r\n\r\nThe Olympics has been a great opportunity to see this in action. Ten million people here in the UK watched Chris Hoy\u2019s final race and all of us thought he\u2019d lost his lead - and the race - coming into the final bank. But then, in what seemed an impossible moment of strength, he found something and pulled ahead to take the gold. In interviews, he clearly had no idea how he\u2019d done it either. You could see it too in the utter surprise on Kat Copeland\u2019s face when she and Sophie Hosking won gold or in Manteo Mitchell, finishing his part in a relay on a broken leg because he didn\u2019t want to let his team down!\r\n\r\nMy own sporting achievements are rather more limited of course, but after a decade of inactivity I\u2019ve now become a pretty committed cyclist, regular swinger of kettlebells and occasional runner. I\u2019m the fittest I\u2019ve ever been and have lost a shockingly large amount of weight. And the best thing is, I\u2019ve no idea what my body is really capable of, or just how far (and how fast!) I can go. But watching the world\u2019s athletes giving their all and exceeding even the massive expectations placed on their shoulders makes me wonder if it\u2019s further than ever seemed possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Clarke\r\nhello@psclarke.co.uk\r\nNottingham, UK\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 12]]
