["[The Listserve] My, Would You Look at the Time", "Charles Austin", "I\u2019m reading a book called \u201cDaily Rituals: How Artists Work\u201d that catalogues the daily habits of famous authors, artists, composers, and so on from the past few centuries. It\u2019s got some helpful tips (e.g. this one courtesy of statesman and turkey enthusiast Ben Franklin: make a list of your goals for the day in the morning; at night, ask yourself what you\u2019ve accomplished) but the most striking commonality among these great minds is that most of them had the luxury to devote their entire lives to what they loved.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m 25 now and I\u2019ve spent the better part of three years working the kind of meaningless office job that\u2019s conspicuously absent from most stories in that book. I\u2019m not delusional enough to think I\u2019m on par with Beethoven or Shakespeare or somebody, but I think I can do better than an office job. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019d love to invent the light bulb, but some guy already did it. And we already have the other stuff that people need, like cotton gins and Angry Birds.\r\n\r\nSo for now, all I can do is make the best use of my time outside the office. The older I get, the more conscious I become about how to spend my time wisely. I try to ask myself whether any activity I\u2019m doing is meaningful to me and why. I\u2019ve spent so much time in my life on passive activities with no value to me. Watching reruns of the Fresh Prince, reading Buzzfeed lists of the 17 Kittens Most Likely to Run for Congress. It all makes me want to regurgitate that one clich\u00e9 about how time is our most precious resource, but you guys already know that. And actually\u2026 Water is probably more important.\r\n\r\nOkay. Sorry, but while we\u2019re on the subject of water, I\u2019m going to make a recommendation and say I\u2019m pretty sure everybody on this list would enjoy reading David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u201cThis is Water.\u201d It\u2019s really quick and breezy and you can find it free online.\r\n\r\nDid you read \u201cThis is Water\u201d? Okay, good. It\u2019s pretty synonymous with my own thoughts on the importance of being conscious of the little decisions we all make in life. Which brings me back to my main point. While I don\u2019t think I have enough skills or direction to quit my aforementioned office job quite yet, I try to spend my free time in ways that matter to me. Mostly I play music, record music, read, and write longwinded ListServe emails.\r\n\r\nUsing the internet as my guide I\u2019ve gotten alright at recording music\u2014I\u2019ve got Pro Tools and all the usual-suspect cheap mics\u2014SM57s, MXL 990s\u2014but I\u2019d love to learn in a more formalized manner. It seems like kind of a crass request to tack on here, but do you guys know anybody who works in a recording studio in Chicago? I was once an intern for a well-known TV show so I am an expert at running errands, doing chores, and providing unpaid labor in a professional setting.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I hope everybody takes a moment each evening\u2014like Ben Franklin\u2014to think about what they did that was meaningful that day. Most of us will never have our faces on money or sign a Declaration of Independence but hopefully we can make the best of the time we\u2019ve got.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Austin\r\ncgoten@gmail.com\r\nChicago, IL\r\n\r\n", [2013, 9, 28]]
