["[The Listserve] Something Unexpected", "Kate", "I've been thinking this through for the past day or so. I have a lot of questions I'd love to ask, or answers I'd love to hear. Or, maybe I could tell a story. Something inspiring.\r\n\r\nI think what I want to know...is something that I don't already know. So, Listserve, tell me something I don't know. Tell me something unexpected. \r\n\r\nWhat is something unexpected, that you know, that I don't know? Maybe it's a fact, maybe it's a story, maybe it's your biggest fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nxo\r\n\r\nKate\r\nkaitlin.hackenberg@gmail.com\t\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n", [2013, 2, 9]]
