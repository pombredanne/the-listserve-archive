["[The Listserve] Never Have I Ever", "Cory Johnson", "Never Have I Ever\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever held the hand of a homeless person?\r\n\r\nI have.\r\n\r\nIt was dirty, bruised, and scarred.\r\n\r\nBut it gripped like any other hand,\r\n\r\nReaching out to be acknowledged\r\n\r\nAnd holding on dearly to a momentary connection.\r\n\r\nAnd it felt good\r\n\r\nTo not be invisible\r\n\r\nTo not be alone!\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever witnessed a hate crime?\r\n\r\nI have.\r\n\r\nIt strikes you down, paralyzes you, and swallows you whole.\r\n\r\nBut it forces you to shed your naivety,\r\n\r\nArming you with a new sense of purpose:\r\n\r\nA desire to look never again into bruised eyes\r\n\r\nAnd utter the lie \"it's okay.\"\r\n\r\nBecause it's not.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever have I ever forgotten\r\n\r\nThat the depth and breadth of humanity are infinite,\r\n\r\nExtending in all directions.\r\n\r\nAnd never will I ever forget\r\n\r\nThat we must live through it all;\r\n\r\nWe must live for it all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCory Johnson\t  \r\ncajohnson414@gmail.com\t \r\nMiami, FL\r\n\r\n", [2013, 2, 14]]
