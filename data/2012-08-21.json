["[The Listserve] Let's meet, internet stranger.", "Nicole He", "Hello, stranger.\r\n\r\nMy name is Nicole. I live in Brooklyn, NY, work at Kickstarter, and I like knitting, tiny instruments, and avocados.  I'm interested in internet communities, but what really tickles me is bridging that terrifying gap between cyberspace and meatspace. \r\n\r\nSo, let's try something. \r\n\r\nOn Sunday, August 26th at 1 pm EST, I am going to be at the following coordinates:\r\n\r\n40.667602,-73.970831 \r\n\r\n(Note: If you're using an iPhone, Google Maps does a weird thing where sometimes it shows you an incorrect pin on a path nearby, which isn't the right place, but it should show the correct pin on a computer. If it looks like it's in the middle of nowhere, it's correct. Email me for details. Or leave it up to fate.)\r\n\r\nI will bring a blanket, a kite, a ukulele, and food. You will be there too, bringing your friends, your dogs, your friends' dogs, cookies, napkins, instruments, brown-bagged beer, and anything or anyone else you'd like. It's entirely possible that it'll just be you and me, sitting awkwardly around a bowl of browning guacamole. Or maybe it'll be you and me and 20,915 of our closest internet friends. Who knows?\r\n\r\nI have a mole under my eye and I'll be wearing red. \r\n\r\nSee you soon. \r\n\r\n\r\nNicole He \r\nbrooklynpicnicole@gmail.com \r\nBrooklyn, NY\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 21]]
