["[The Listserve] Alive", "Jeremy Apthorp", "A close friend of mine this week had a heart attack.\r\n\r\nHe's 21.\r\n\r\nBy a miracle, someone was close by who administered CPR, and he's undergone cold therapy, and there appears to be no neurological damage. He's awake and lucid, though he doesn't remember that we had dinner together a few days before the event. He doesn't remember what happened, he doesn't remember feeling any pain.\u00a0He just wasn't, for a while.\r\n\r\nThis has been an intense reminder that everything that I am and anything I care about could evaporate at any time, with no warning.\r\n\r\nMake every day the best day of your life.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremy Apthorp\r\nnornagon@nornagon.net\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 30]]
