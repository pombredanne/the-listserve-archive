["[The Listserve] Add Some Music To Your Day", "Barton Lewis", "How often do you listen to music? I mean, really listen? I could go on about actual scientific studies that link music to a whole host of physical and psychological benefits, but rather than rattle on here, try it.\r\n\r\nA musician myself, I\u2019ve played the piano for about half my life. I don\u2019t profess to be any good, in fact I\u2019d say I\u2019m rather rubbish (though my friends & fans would likely say otherwise). In the beginning, I would do everything by rote. Always playing from sheet music, never improvising, and not truly understanding the underlying logic of what I was playing. It was not until I shipped off to college sans my mammoth sheet music collection that I first forced myself to try to play from memory \u2013 I recall repeatedly enthusing myself with the crashing  I-V-IV progression of The Who\u2019s Baba O\u2019Riley and feeling better than I ever did playing Chopin.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve since found that by simply listening to music on a regular basis, I\u2019ve become a better musician, and my life has improved too. I started writing my own tunes, and running regularly listening to music, getting into the best shape of my life. I put together a band called The Medicine (music is medicine, after all) and have a whole bunch of material that you can find under my own name (or username brtnlewis) on SoundCloud. I\u2019d appreciate your feedback on my own creations, and any thoughts or musings on any of this stuff in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBarton\r\nblewisNYU@gmail.com\r\n@brtnlewis\r\nManhattan\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 25]]
