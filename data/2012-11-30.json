["[The Listserve] the memory that knows where you live", "Olga Nunes", "1.\r\n\r\nHe is everywhere.\r\n\r\nLurking in the woodsmoke that fills the house in winter, there's a memory of the first time we built a fire together.\r\n\r\nCleverly tucked into the taste of cinnamon and cider, there's a memory of us walking underneath the changing leaves, steaming mugs of autumn in our hands.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's not so simple.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's a whiff of cologne in a crowd, and I am reminded of a shirt he used to own-- and the memory of that shirt unlocks whole passages of time spent together I hadn't thought of in years.  The images come flooding back; the porch we'd argue on, the bed we slept in, the trip we planned for months and never took.\r\n\r\nYou know the feeling: all it takes is one tiny thing, a domino, and a whole world of the past tumbles into focus. Triggered by a smell.  A touch.  A song.\r\n\r\nMemory.\r\n\r\n\r\n 2.\r\n\r\nLet's play a game.\r\n\r\nMy name is Olga Nunes. I'm a singer, and for the past two years, I've been working on an album called LAMP.  LAMP has a story woven around it, and I'd very much like for you to be a part of that story.  \r\n\r\n\r\n 3.\r\n\r\nCall this number: 1.415.857.0589\r\n\r\nIt leads to a Google voicemail box; you can call it from anywhere.  When you call, you will be asked a question.  Answer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n 4.\r\n\r\nI'll post those answers to a blog just for this, and will make them part of the LAMP story.\r\n\r\nFeel free to Google \"Olga Nunes LAMP\" to hear the songs, or see how this has unfolded so far.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your call.\t\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Warmth, \r\nOlga Nunes \r\nolga@olganunes.com \r\nSan Francisco, California\r\n\r\nP.S. Just in case: if the number gives you a busy signal, try calling back. \r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 30]]
