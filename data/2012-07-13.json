["[The Listserve] My American dream: Route 66", "Alvaro. M. H\u00a0", "Happiness is to achieve your dreams and enjoy the road. These words are dedicated to a dream that begun 7 years ago, during my first days in university. There, one day, Maria and I decided to embark in the adventure of crossing the United States through Route 66.\r\n\r\nRoute 66 is the mother road of America, it is the road of hopes that crosses 8 States from Chicago to Los Angeles, Route 66 is a magical experience that lives and will live forever, in the heart of those who once lived the adventure.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt was almost a year ago, after graduation, when the dream became true. Mar\u00eda and I set forth to on the trip that changed our lives. Every single mile from Chicago to Los Angeles was magical. The adventure lasted 35 unforgettable days and it was during that time that we realized we lost part of our hearts there.\r\n\r\nThe dream is still alive inside us, and that\u2019s why we are so sure that Destiny has kept a place for us on Route 66. Times may change, but Route 66 is alive and kicking like never before.\r\nI\u2019d like to say goodbye with the words of Jack Kerouac\r\n\r\n\u201cI was halfway across America, at the dividing line between the East of my youth and the West of my future.\u201d Jack Kerouac, On the Road\r\n\r\n\u00c1lvaro M.H\r\nalvaro@enjoyroute66.com\r\nMadrid, Spain\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 13]]
