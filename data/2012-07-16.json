["[The Listserve] Raspberry rhubarb muffins", "Miles", "I know it's a very hot summer in places right now but these muffins are completely worth it.\r\n(Sorry for mixing unit types here, but these are from my notes and what I know works for me)\r\n\r\n375g AP flour\r\n265g Brown sugar (I prefer dark)\r\n2.5tsp Baking powder (from a can opened <6mo ago)\r\n0.5tsp Baking soda\r\n0.25tsp cinnamon (ground fresh ceylon)\r\n0.25tsp nutmeg (ground fresh)\r\n0.25tsp salt\r\n1.0 egg\r\n1.25cup buttermilk\r\n0.5cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled\r\n2.0tsp vanilla extract\r\n1.0cup raspberries\r\n1.0cup rhubarb, choppped\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 400F\r\n\r\nTopping:\r\n0.5cup chopped pecans\r\n0.33cup brown sugar, packed\r\n0.25tsp cinnamon\r\n1.0Tbsp cold butter\r\n\r\nCombine ingredients in food processor, pulse until they resemble coarse crumbs\r\n\r\nMuffins\r\nWhisk together flour, baking {powder,soda}, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt\r\nIn a separate bowl combine sugar, buttermilk, butter, egg, and vanilla\r\nCombine the two mixtures, mixing until roughly combined\r\nAdd in fruit, stir three times to distribute\r\nPour into muffin liners in a muffin tin (makes 12-18)\r\nSprinkle topping onto batter\r\nBake @400F for 20-25min\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on muffins:\r\nFresh ground spices are THE BEST. Get a microplane for ~$10 and you'll be set.\r\nNothing in the world smells as good as fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg.\r\n\r\nHaving fresh baking powder is important. It reacts with air and loses potentcy.\r\nMuffins are chemically levened by the reaction between the acidic buttermilk\r\nand tartaric acid in baking powder and the basic baking soda.\r\n\r\nMuffins get their texture from being roughly mixed. You only need to mix until\r\nall the flour is wet; any more and you risk developing gluten strands and\r\nmaking your muffins chewy, with a cake-like crumb.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nMiles\r\nmstromb@gmail.com\r\nSeattle, WA\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 16]]
