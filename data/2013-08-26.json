["[The Listserve] How I Met Your Mother (Not Your Mother)", "Aaron Mitchell", "Hi\r\n\r\nI have to confess I\u2019ve not been keeping up with my Listserv reading so if you\u2019re reading this let me first say thank you for indulging me a few moments.\r\n\r\nI live in a desert in the north west of Australia, what I like to call Mad Max country. As a result my oldest son goes to boarding school far away and we see him once a month. This has been hard on me (not on him, he loves it) as I always wanted to be there for all his experiences.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to share a little something with him, and I guess all of you, about love and about his mother.\r\n\r\nI had known Gayle for a few years in passing as a friend, actually a girlfriend, of a friend. After I\u2019d been away for a while, I went for drinks with friends at the house she was living at. She was single at the time and so was I and during the slightly intoxicated chatting we accidentally finished each other\u2019s sentence. We glanced at each other, she smiled slyly, I grinned like a Muppet, and a spark leapt between us.\r\n\r\nI know, I know; it sounds painfully clich\u00e9. We might as well be bumping into each other on a snowy night in New York and getting Christmas presents mixed up. But I swear that\u2019s how it happened. The spark was soon followed by thunder bolts, fireworks, the whole deal.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly we both tried to play it cool at first, or at least convince ourselves we were playing it cool. But nine months later I cracked, I was away for work again at a resort at a nearby island called Rottnest (supposedly Dutch for Rats Nest as the poor Danish explorers thought the tiny kangaroo type marsupials called Quokkas were giant rats), when I called her and asked her to marry me. We threw together an amazing wedding in three weeks and have spent the last decade and a half on our honeymoon.\r\n\r\nNow my son, and you, might ask why I was so damn sure about this girl. But I didn\u2019t really do any maths over it, It just seemed like destiny. But looking back now I see so many things about my wife I desired, her strength, her independence, her passion, her kindness, her intelligence and her considerable beauty; faced with all that when it came to loving her I didn\u2019t have a choice.\r\n\r\nLove should always be easy, marriage is hard and takes work, relationships are hard, but the love should be easy. If you\u2019re in a relationship and the love is tough work but the relationship is easy, then it\u2019s not going to work, bad news, your dating someone you should be friends with.\r\n\r\nGet rid of lists and all preconceived notions. If you\u2019re looking for someone in a select range of interests, or of a particular appearance, you\u2019re setting yourself up to fail. Because when love strikes it ignores all of that.\r\n\r\nWhen it does happen, when you know, it\u2019s indescribably wonderful, you feel like the luckiest person in the world. And no matter how much of a sceptical, cynical smart arse I claim to be, and I do, I absolutely believe in that one small piece of magic that can happen between two people. That spark that seems so ethereal, seemingly magical, that you hear many people express doubts it exists all together. But I have never doubted its existence.\r\n\r\nBecause it happened to me.\r\n\r\nAaron Mitchell\r\naaronjgmitchell@gmail.com\r\nAustralia\r\n\r\n", [2013, 8, 26]]
