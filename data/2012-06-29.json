["[The Listserve] Insight", "Adam Ahlgren", "When I first signed up for The Listserve some time ago I was full of skepticism, hopes and\u00a0delusion. Then the projects started and I started to\u00a0receive\u00a0email after email; Beautiful words forming advice, tips and precautions that everyone really should take part of. Irregardless of it's purpose - it is fun hearing about other people.\r\n\r\nMyself, I am some what of a metaphorically half-blind Sherlock Holmes and have some academic background in everything human.\u00a0What I would like to add is some, although\u00a0paradoxical, insight into the human condition. The problem, as I see it with most things in life, is that 99% of people never ever - listen - to - advice. You have your life and live it by the understanding your experiences have shaped over time. \u00a0It takes a unique openness and self control - insight - to actually adapt your life to things you have not yet realized yourself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBe aware!\r\n\r\nAdam Ahlgren\r\nadamahlgren@gmail.com\r\nStockholm, Sweden\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 29]]
