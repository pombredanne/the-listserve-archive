["[The Listserve] An Awkward Life", "Connor A.", "I\u2019m still not sure what the title of my (auto)biography is going to be, but the subtitle will most certainly be An Awkward Life. Perhaps I\u2019m starring on a reality TV show and don\u2019t know it yet, but I find myself in a fair number of truly awkward and comical situations. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my penchant for saying the first thing that comes to mind or just some karmatic effect from a previous life, but regardless, I\u2019ve got a lot of good fodder for my future stand-up comedy routine.\r\n\r\nMy most recent I\u2019m-pretty-sure-the-Universe-is-laughing-at-me moment happened last month when I was en route to what was most certainly going to be a break-up conversation. I was getting out of my car to meet my then boyfriend when I heard the distinct sound of fabric tearing. I looked down to see a hole in the crotch of my pants. The timing couldn\u2019t have been worse, but it did give me a few minutes to laugh at myself before a truly unpleasant conversations. These things happen to me more often than I can count, but I have come to enjoy and embrace the comedic relief it brings to otherwise dull or unpleasant situations.. When I came out to my mom over dinner, she thought I was playing a practical joke for a while. Trying to prove that it wasn\u2019t a joke proved pretty uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI could fill the rest of this e-mail with some of my favorite stories, but I\u2019ll try and keep it brief. I\u2019d love to hear from you guys on a host of things. I\u2019m a total and complete news junkie who is obsessed with politics and public policy. So, a few things I\u2019d like to hear from you about:\r\n\r\n1) My favorite book at the moment is Nudge by Cass Sunstein. The book basically discusses choice architecture and how we can build a smarter planet to make up for the fact that we humans often make decisions that aren\u2019t in our best long-term interests (think saving for retirement, eating healthy foods, climate change, etc.) If you\u2019ve read Nudge or have an interest or experience in designing better systems of any kind, I\u2019d love to hear about your work.\r\n\r\n2) What are your awkward and comical stories?\r\n\r\n3) I\u2019m interested in how people work, particularly GTD and organizational strategies. Feel free to share some good advice/tips in this arena. I\u2019ll also accept any life advice you\u2019d like to give in general.\r\n\r\n4) I work in fundraising/development, focused primarily in politics and the non-profit world. If you work in these fields, I\u2019d love to connect.\r\n\r\n5) Finally, if you know any single and awesome gay guys in the DC-area, I love awkward first dates. They make for the best stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, y\u2019all!\r\n\r\n-Connor\r\nigotpickedforthelistserv+e@gmail.com\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\n", [2013, 11, 11]]
