["[The Listserve] Gratitude", "Xie Liju", "Hi there!  I'm a 22 year old Singaporean and I'm an  undergraduate student studying in Perth.  I signed up for  Listserve for the exciting prospect of reading and learning  new and beautiful things from everyone in this community.   And now that it's my turn, what would I say to a million  people if I had the chance? \r\n\r\nI've thought long and hard (3 hours of typing and backspacing),  bugged tonnes (4) of friends, and ate 6 scoops of ice cream.   Here's what I'd like to say to a million people.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to thank my family (my dad, mom and sis)  for being the most imperfect, annoying, nagging, beautiful,  supportive, loving family.  I have always told them through  Skype and Facetime that I love them on the phone but since  it doesn't count unless a million people hears it, so I'd  like to shout \"I LOVE YOU\" to my family.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'd wanna thank all you previous contributors  for making me smile/laugh/appreciate honey/rotate my  head/cook.  Nary a morning that goes by that I do not  open my inbox first thing in the morning to read the  contribution for the day.  I'd also like to thank all  future contributors for what is to come because writing  this one email is hard work!\r\n\r\nLastly, I'd love to thank my ALL friends for being  absolutely amazing, Franc Roddam for Masterchef, Kelly  Clarkson for her voice, ancient Chinese for creating  ice cream, Aztecs/Mayans for chocolate, and you for reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiju \r\nxielijuu@gmail.com \r\nPerth, Western Australia\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 17]]
