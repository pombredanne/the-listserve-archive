["[The Listserve] Every Vote Counts", "David Filip", "I think people these days, for the most part, have been tricked into believing that their vote doesn\u2019t count. But it does \u2013 your voice counts. You need to make sure that you pay attention to what affects you directly. If you don\u2019t vote, you\u2019re giving up your right to direct what happens to and around you. Figure out what representative (and by representative I mean anyone for whom you can vote to hold public office) best represents your views on the world, how you want the world to be, how you see the world progressing, and vote for them. It\u2019s quite simple.\r\n\r\nOver half of the subscribers to the Listserve have elections coming up in their respective countries, but this email isn\u2019t just for them, it\u2019s for everyone to keep in mind. Having a voice in shaping the future of your country, however small you think it may be, is something truly revolutionary. Indeed, few times in the course of history have conglomerations of people been able to direct the fate of their nations, and as such, this right (to vote) should not be taken for granted. Of course, people differ in their views for how they think their countries should progress, but in closing I think this quote from Voltaire will be to most people\u2019s liking: \u201cI may not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.\u201d\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid\r\nAplucsued@gmail.com\r\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 8]]
