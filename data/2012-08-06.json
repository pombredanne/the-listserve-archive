["[The Listserve] Coming full circle", "Patrick Beeker", "Hello friend distant or near,\r\n\r\nLet me share a part of my life with you. Exactly two years ago I started my current job. At a hostel chain in the Netherlands where - after being in social welfare for nearly a year - I was so happy to fine a full-time position. Which meant I would have (more) money, and would be able to leave my parents place again. To which I was more or less forced due to a lack of financial means at age 28\u2026after having lived by myself the previous 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe last two years have passed swiftly. I have paid off all my student debts; poring nearly 1000 EUR in your debt the day your salary arrives feels awkward I can tell you that. (small note: fuck this debt-ridden consumptionism society). At work I have revamped almost the complete web infrastructure. Money is being made, and everybody is happy. But I'll leave my job end of August. I see question marks on the faces of all my colleagues: why leave before reaping what you saw? There is crisis out there!? It is time to move on.\r\n\r\nTo what, to where? I don't know. Having arrived at age 30 I thought the road to take would somehow be easier, contours would be more crisp. The exact opposite is the case\u2026 I don't have a clue, I'm totally fucking lost.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I might have some hard and/or confusing months ahead, but I think I'm ready for it. I've come full circle, and it's time for something new. I take comfort in the phrase I've just read on George profile (last night's couchsurfer):\r\n\r\n> If you don't know where you're going, then you'll never get lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nGodspeed,\r\nPatrick Beeker\r\npatrick.beeker@gmail.com\r\n@pbeeker\r\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\r\n\r\nP.S. Write me if you're in Amsterdam I love meeting new people.\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 6]]
