["[The Listserve] Learn", "Lila Rimalovski", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I know a lot more than everybody else; it\u2019s that I want to know more.\u201d\r\n\r\nA very wise woman said these words to me, and I have breathed them in ever since.\r\n\r\nIf you have that desire\u2014that spark\u2014to dedicate a minute, an hour, a day, or your life to learning, amazing things can and will change. This doesn\u2019t mean sitting in a classroom and listening to lectures, this means immersing yourself in new situations, new places, new conversations, and new perspectives.\r\n\r\nI plan to live with this mindset for the rest of my life. The smallest changes in my daily routine teach me so much; I have learned from these experiences and learned to take bigger, and bigger risks.\r\n\r\nListen to This American Life, eat a chocolate mousse cake for a snack, be a Buddhist for a day, move to Indonesia, backpack, read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime over and over again, laugh too often, cry even more, smile, befriend a stranger, embarrass yourself, swap music with a friend, speak Mandarin, compliment somebody for no reason, learn.\r\n\r\nShare this mindset. And share it with me. Tell me your stories, how to learn, who to learn from, what to learn, and what I can teach others.\r\n\r\nIn the wise words of the very same woman, \u201cSharing is the second hardest thing in life, the first is finding people to share with.\u201d\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nLila Rimalovski, 15\r\nlilaslistserve@gmail.com\r\nNew Jersey\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 16]]
