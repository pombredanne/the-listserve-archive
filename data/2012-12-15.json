["[The Listserve]  I\u2019m the same as a 5 year old me", "Christine", "I hate small talk.  It drives me nuts.  I\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m basically anti-social.  I\u2019ve struggled with it my whole life.  I am 27 now, and I feel that I should be less pessimistic, but I\u2019m not.  I have a support system of family and a fianc\u00e9 who \u201cget\u201d me.  But, I have no friends of my own, though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a total freak.  I have two modes, I either open up completely to people who I shouldn\u2019t because I see them as \u201cdifferent\u201d or I dismiss people who I think are too \u201cnormal\u201d.  I don\u2019t know why I have a need to connect on a deep level.  It\u2019s my eternal struggle and I just wanted to share it\u2026\r\n\r\nI lost my cousin earlier this year.  He was 23.  I wish he could have stuck around to become the person I know he was.  I put my cat down on Saturday.  I\u2019ve had him \u00bd of my life.  I miss you guys.\r\n\r\nI perform improv in Chicago.  My fianc\u00e9 speculated that people in the comedy / improv community are probably more in tune to when people are depressed, etc. and are more likely to address it, because we either are / or have dealt with it at some point.  And\u2026I agree.  I\u2019m shy to a fault and I got into improv, begrudgingly, and honestly it is refreshing, I would love to get kids dealing with depression involved in it.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and here\u2019s my self-promotion, I am a front-end web developer, I want to open a pickle shop, I want to start an animal charity program, I want to write / make performance art / make music / make art / make films.  Let\u2019s see how that goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristine\r\nchristine.listserve@gmail.com\r\nChicago, IL, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 15]]
