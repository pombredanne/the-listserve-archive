["[The Listserve] People", "Drew Schilson", "There is so much I'd like to say about urban, environmental, gender, and art history here. That's what I'm prone to do as a student of the Evergreen State College. With such complex problems and solutions in constant rotation, at constant attention, there is one thing I'd like to remind us all of: people are people regardless of anything.\r\n\r\nThere's a song that sums up what I think is a really important and simple idea that French author Simone de Beauvoir brought to life in her novel \"The Mandarins,\" through a Sartre-esque character, which is that, beyond any outcome or decision, people will still inhabit the earth. \r\n\r\nPlease google the song \"People\" by Andrew Jackson Jihad (a clever historical name, considering his Native policies and ideas - - relevant to American moralism in relation to \"terror\"). \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't, what I want to say here is a (couple) line(s) from that song:\r\n\r\nAnd people are people regardless of skin. \r\nAnd people are people regardless of creed. \r\nPeople are people regardless of gender \r\nPeople are people regardless of anything...\r\n\r\nAnd people are my religion because I believe in them \r\nAnd people are my enemies, and people are my friends. \r\nI have faith in my fellow man, and I only hope that he has faith in me.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrew Schilson\r\nschdre01@evergreen.edu\r\nOlympia, WA, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 13]]
