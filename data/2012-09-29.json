["[The Listserve] A deeper appreciation", "Daniel K Lyons", "Stop optimizing your life.\r\n\r\nBecome excellent at something. Then, teach it to at least two kids. You can learn the whole world through becoming great at one thing.\r\n\r\nThere is nowhere you are freer than in your own thoughts. Do not censor yourself in the privacy of your own mind. Allow yourself to think the unthinkable\u2014neither shy away nor dwell too long.\r\n\r\nIf something makes no sense, think about it harder until it does.\r\n\r\nWhen you are asked something, think until your second thought arrives, then speak.\r\n\r\nThe process of learning who you are is unsettling and unpleasant. Do it anyway. Know yourself. Nobody else will want to until you do.\r\n\r\nCultivate patience. Work on rhetoric\u2014every language is beautiful.\r\n\r\nSlow down. Quality is always better than quantity.\r\n\r\nPredict negatively. That way, you will either be right (pleasant) or surprised by a better outcome (also pleasant). Either way, make an effort to appreciate the present.\r\n\r\nAny interaction that begins by raising your blood pressure and ends with opening your wallet is manipulation. Do not be confused by a trusted source.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel K Lyons\r\nfusion@storytotell.org\r\nSocorro, NM, USA\r\n", [2012, 9, 29]]
