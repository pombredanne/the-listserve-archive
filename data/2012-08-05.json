["[The Listserve] Smile!", "Becky Stewart", "I\u2019d like to draw your attention to Bhutan, a unique nation bordering India and China. Although it is considered to be a developing country, I think the Bhutanese are in fact leading the rest of us in a fundamental area: Their national goal of, not Gross National Product, but rather Gross National Happiness. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s a real thing \u2013 an entire nation of people who collectively concern themselves with attaining happiness rather than money. Awesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by their ideals, I try to take time daily out of my busy Canadian life to do simple things that make me smile:\r\n\r\n-Read the comics every morning\r\n\r\n-Participate in the art of people-watching and delight in those who break the mold (this weekend I met a priest who rides a motorcycle!)\r\n\r\n-Sing in the car on the way to work \u2013 LOUD \u2013 even when I\u2019m way off key and the only thing on is Carly Rae Jepsen or One Direction.\r\n\r\n-Smile \u2013 really smile \u2013 at strangers on the street. It\u2019s incredible how contagious a smile can be; it\u2019s almost always reciprocated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo today, I ask you to do one simple thing that makes you smile. Wear your best underwear; Listen to your favourite song; Call an old friend; Bake some cupcakes; Learn a joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope I\u2019ve given you reason to smile, or at least made you think about it.  Please feel free to contact me - I\u2019d love to hear what you did today in pursuit of happiness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSending you a smile,\r\n\r\nBecky\r\nrmstewart9@gmail.com\r\nKingston, Canada\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 5]]
