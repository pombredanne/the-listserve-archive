["[The Listserve] Striving for Happiness", "Amy Cunningham", "I see a lot of people who share jokes.  I like to laugh and want to be happy in this life. I would like to share something I came across in some random email that I read often and strive to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember these five simple rules to be happy:\r\n\r\n1)    Free your heart from hatred.\r\n\r\n2)    Free your mind from worries.\r\n\r\n3)    Live simply.\r\n\r\n4)    Give more.\r\n\r\n5)    Expect less.\r\n\r\nIn my life I also strive to live the Plan of Happiness, which would be my #6.  I told my husband (who is also a Listserve subscriber) that if I won, I would share one of the biggest things that bring me happiness.\r\n\r\n6)    Living the gospel of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nI believe that I am a child of God.  I have a Savior who is Jesus Christ.  He knows me personally and better than I know myself.  He knows my trials and struggles in life as well as all my joys and triumphs.  He wants me to be happy. Most of all he loves me.  I am grateful that he died for my sins so that I may one day return back to him.   I know that families do not have to go to \u201cdeath do you part\u201d, but that we can be together for eternity.  This knowledge brings me peace and joy.  We recently lost a daughter in January and I know that we will one day be reunited with her.  I know that a 14 year old boy named Joseph Smith prayed to our father in heaven and received a personal witness from him and our Savior not to join any other churches and that the  fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored today on the earth through him.  I believe in modern day prophets and I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the living prophet in our day who leads us and guides us today.  I know that along with the Holy Bible that the Book of Mormon is the true word of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, if you haven\u2019t already guessed I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Living the Gospel of Jesus Christ brings me the most joy and happiness as well as serving others.  If you would like to know more or have any questions, please feel free to email me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmy Cunningham\r\nnaaanc@gmail.com\r\nCharlotte, NC\r\n\r\n", [2013, 10, 29]]
