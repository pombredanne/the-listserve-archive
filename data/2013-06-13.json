["[The Listserve] LISTEN UP", "Steven Page", "Hello everyone !\r\n\r\nMy name is Steven Page, and I live in Montreal, most precisely in the Verdun area. You may be interested in Free Shit Verdun, which is something that me, my friend (Hi, Ludauvick) and my girlfriend (Hi, Catherine) started just about a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept is simple : We give free shit in Verdun.\r\n\r\nWe have a free library 24/7 in front of our apartment where people can take books and also give some. From time to time, we give some free stuff with a huge \u201cFREE\u201d panel. It makes people happy, and our neighbours love it.\r\n\r\nTomorrow (Thurday the 6th), we will be doing a \u201cCin\u00e9 Free\u201d event, which is basically a movie that we screen in front of our apartment, near the street. People bring beer and popcorn, we vote for a movie and we chill all night. If you are in the Montreal area, you can come over if you want !\r\n\r\nJust type Free Shit Verdun in Facebook and you\u2019ll get all you need to know.\r\n\r\nAND NOW, SOME FREE INSPIRATIONAL SHIT :\r\n\r\nHere are some of my favorite quotes \u201cAn extraterrestrial being, newly arrived on Earth - scrutinizing what we mainly present to our children in television, radio, movies, newspapers, magazines, the comics, and many books - might easily conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape, cruelty, superstition, credulity, and consumerism. We keep at it, and through constant repetition many of them finally get it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn science it often happens that scientists say, \"You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,\" and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrederick Douglas taught that literacy is the path from slavery to freedom. There are many kinds of slavery and many kinds of freedom, but reading is still the path.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n ALSO, BE AWARE OF THIS : Legal counterfeiting of a national currency for private gains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND FINALLY : I\u2019d just like to take some time to salute someone very important to me. Cath, c\u2019\u00e9tait ta f\u00eate le 31 et je crois que c\u2019est encore temps de te faire une petite surprise. En fait, tous les jours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e peuvent \u00eatre bons pour \u00e7a :) Alors voil\u00e0, je ne t\u2019avais pas dit que j\u2019avais gagn\u00e9 le listserve. Cette fois, c\u2019est pas un troll, j\u2019ai gagn\u00e9 pour de vrai. Tu as le visage d\u2019un ange du moment o\u00f9 tu te l\u00e8ves le matin jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 tu te couches le soir, et tout \u00e7a sans avoir \u00e0 mettre de d\u00e9guisement sur ton visage. Je t\u2019aime comme \u00e7a. Tu es une des seules personnes avec qui je peux d\u00e9compresser. Merci d\u2019\u00eatre chill.\r\n\r\nGOOD DAY TO EVERYONE !!!!!! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteven Page\t\r\nstevenp291288@gmail.com\t\r\nCanada, Quebec, Montreal\r\n\r\n", [2013, 6, 13]]
