["[The Listserve] Reading stories", "C\u00e9line Mouzon", "Hi, people of the world,\r\n\r\nLike most of you, I guess, I've been reading stories since I was a\r\nchild, and I stlil do. I also write stories. True stories: I'm a\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\nOne of my obsession and great wonder, especially when there is so much\r\nto read/watch/etc., is: What makes us read a story till the end?\r\n\r\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this. You can\r\n\u2022\u2022 send me a link toward stories you loved (text, film, multimedia, whatever),\r\n\u2022\u2022 share your thoughts on this topic,\r\n\u2022\u2022 do both.\r\n+ You can share your craziest thoughts on new ways of telling stories,\r\nways that you'd love to experience, but haven't so far.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to read what you have to say!\r\n\r\n\r\nC\u00e9line Mouzon\r\nceline.mouzon@gmail.com\r\nParis, France\r\n\r\n", [2013, 3, 20]]
