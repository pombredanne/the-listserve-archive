["[The Listserve] Explore. Dream. Discover", "Anna B.", "I, more recently than not, have this mindset that if I don't ask, try or do I will never know.\r\n\r\nI have kept so many things unsaid thinking that people can read my mind and have ended up disappointed in the outcome but really I should have just said what I felt or taken the next appropriate step before the disappointment came to sneak up on me. I have the \u201cjust do it\u201d mindset now with everything in my life - whether it\u2019s going up to someone new, asking for a promotion, or just being bold and trying to get what I want in life. A lot of situations shock me when it turns out in a positive way but of course there are things that don't turn out how I want them to but that just leads me to believe it is not meant to be. I truly believe that everything happens for a reason and leads me to the next place that IS meant for me.\r\n\r\nEmbrace your path, take the chance/risk (so long as it is in a positive way) and live your life how you want. Things left unsaid will always be unsaid; things left undone will always be waiting to be finished....\r\n\r\nCreate Yourself\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna B.\r\nfeetwonttouchtheground@gmail.com\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n", [2012, 10, 27]]
