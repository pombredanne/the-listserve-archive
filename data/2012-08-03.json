["[The Listserve] Theodor Geisel", "Wesley Brown", "Hello there, Listservers! I hope you\u2019ll enjoy\r\nA message that\u2019s based on a Seussian ploy\r\n\r\nIf you want to write poems the Seussian way\r\nAnapestic tetrameter brooks no delay\r\n\r\nBut Seuss saw this form in its hard, rigid glory\r\nAnd said \u2018Hey, I can do it, and tell quite a story\r\n\r\n\u2018While doing it, too, it will be my new tool\r\nIn telling kids things that they won\u2019t learn in school\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen he came to a line that just wouldn\u2019t quite flourish\r\nHe\u2019d pluck up a word from thin air, and he\u2019d nourish\r\n\r\nThat young little word, brand new to the world\r\nAnd he\u2019d place it in just the right spot, where it whirled\r\n\r\nWhere it danced and it sang like a fresh coat of paint\r\nOver language grown solemn and tempered and quaint\r\n\r\nThe words he invented were zong, zax and zillow\r\nAnd grinch, nerd and vipper, they were bofa and yekko\r\n\r\nThey told all the stories he needed to tell\r\nAnd they broke through a form that would otherwise dwell\r\n\r\nIn the musty old drawers of the humorless past\r\nHe made it seem joyous, a form that would last\r\n\r\nIn the memories of every young kid who was read\r\nFrom a Dr. Seuss book before going to bed\r\n\r\nAnd so, if I\u2019m going to be true to my muse\r\nI\u2019ll leave with a moral that you all might just use\r\n\r\nDr. Seuss saw a dark thing and turned it to light\r\nIf we all do the same, the world sure will be bright.\r\n\r\n\r\nWesley Brown\r\nwbrown3@villanova.edu\r\nArdmore, PA, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 3]]
