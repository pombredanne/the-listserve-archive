["[The Listserve] Be honest with yourself", "Julian A Waters", "2012 was a rough year for me - losing my house, car, credit rating, shifting around friends' places and wasting a bunch of time recovering from technical issues.\r\n\r\nIt was the culmination of years of almost-sensible decisions. I offer one suggestion to avoid this:\r\n\r\nBe honest with yourself.\r\n\r\nLook in the mirror every morning and ask \"what truth am I hiding from?\"\r\n\r\nHere are some ways I've been dishonest with myself:\r\n=> Living like I was close to great entrepreneurial success with really I had no plan.\r\n=> Spending more than I was earning: You don't *need* anything except food and used clothing.\r\n=> Enduring a non-constructive relationship - telling yourself \"marriage is for life\" doesn't make it any happier. Inevitably you'll end up compensating in other ways.\r\n=> Focusing on *appearing* successful rather than *being* successful. Who's \"meaningful\" was I trying to achieve?\r\n=> Believing \"I'm special\" thus ignoring the logical advice of friends & mentors.\r\n\r\nThis is all obvious stuff. Reaching me as \"advice\" it didn't digest deep enough. I needed to experience the painful consequences of not \"living\" it to appreciate in hindsight how I failed to thoroughly practice it.\r\n\r\nI'm working hard to be honest in the mirror. Honest with people around me and inviting honesty.\r\n\r\n2013 is kicking off without the outward symbols of success I held onto so tightly before, but I feel better about myself than ever.\r\n\r\nHappy new year friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulian A Waters\t\r\nme@julianwaters.com\t\r\nAuckland, New Zealand\r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 8]]
