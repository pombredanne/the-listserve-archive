["[The Listserve] Wise words, set to music", "Jeff Robson", "Whenever it comes to finding the right words for a situation (such as now), I often find myself unable to say something clear enough, powerful enough, or smart enough. Luckily, I can always find a songwriter who can do it for me. When I need words of hope or wisdom, or when I need to feel like someone else has felt the same pain and frustration as me, I look for it in song. It seems that here\u2019s always someone who can speak my heart and mind better than I can. Sometimes I need a bit of energy, motivation, a good laugh, or just some entertainment. I find it all in music.\r\n\r\nLook up these writers; I know they\u2019ll give you something that speaks to you. You know how & where to find them. Their songs have done so much for me; the least I can do for them (and for you) is to hope that someone will discover them and enjoy their work, as I have. In no particular order:\r\n\r\nDel Barber\r\nChristina Martin\r\nLeeroy Stagger\r\nJohn K Samson/The Weakerthans\r\nJim Bryson\r\nWillie P Bennett\r\nTownes Van Zandt\r\nPaul Kelly\r\nDavid Francey\r\nMatthew Ryan\r\nRon Hawkins/The Lowest of the Low\r\nThe Warped 45s\r\nThe Blue Shadows\r\nLynn Miles\r\nNQ Arbuckle\r\nShannon Lyon\r\nRose Cousins\r\nOh Susanna\r\nThe Damnwells\r\n\r\nThese are just a few. Without these writers, I might not be alive today. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to get by as well as I do. Let them move you.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeff Robson\r\ntellthebandtogohome@gmail.com\r\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\r\n\r\n", [2012, 9, 7]]
