["[The Listserve] A Light Saber can Light up Your Life", "Mindy", "I want to write about the funniest conversation I have participated in to date.\r\n\r\nMy sister entertains when she doesn\u2019t even mean to. With aspergers syndrome, she is always literal, serious, and takes things exactly as you say them. My sarcastic family doesn\u2019t make life easy for her and yes, I might get a little carried away from time to time, but she has no idea how her unintentional humor lights up our lives.\r\n\r\nShe had just gotten back from her favorite yearly activity \u2013 StarFest, where self-proclaimed dorks and geeks gather in a convention style hotel while wearing their favorite fantasy-inspired costume and participate in well, I went once for moral support and I couldn\u2019t really tell you. I\u2019ll relive that if I get this Listserve opportunity again.\r\n\r\nShe was pooped. And cranky. Her whole life she has worn exhaustion on her sleeve like a sweater and her bitchiness was apparent right off the bat that afternoon. (Disclaimer \u2013 Mitch, name changed, is her now fianc\u00e9)\r\n\r\nMom \u2013 \u201cHoney did you not get a lot of sleep last night?\u201d\r\nSister \u2013 (loud sigh) \u201cPSH uh, NO\u201d\r\nMom \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sorry why is that?\u201d\r\nSister \u2013 \u201cWELL\u2026 the guy lying next to Mitch was snoring SO LOUD we couldn\u2019t sleep\u201d\r\nMe \u2013 \u201cUm, there was a guy next to Mitch?\u201d\r\nSister \u2013 \u201cYeah. And I elbowed Mitch and was like MITCH. GET HIM TO SHUT UP\u201d\r\nMe \u2013 \u201cSo, it\u2019s you, Mitch and this guy?\u201d\r\nSister \u2013 \u201cYeah. So Mitch grabs his light saber and starts to poke him, and FINALLY he shut up but it took awhile so I\u2019m really tired\u201d\r\nMe \u2013 straight face - \u201cWhat exactly do you mean by \u2018light saber\u2019\u201d\r\nSister \u2013 annoyed - \u201cYou have to know what a light saber is\u2026\u201d\r\nMom \u2013 stopping the train wreck -  \u201cMINDY. Enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a rocking chair a few feet away, my dad\u2019s shoulders are shrugging with laughter while he listens in. The next few minutes involved tales of infuriating Star Trek assholes and uninvited furries; long lines for autographs and admissions of needing to \u201cclean the con-funk\u201d off. (Con-funk is the result of several days of not showering while in close quarters with other costume loving individuals \u2013 if you didn\u2019t know that already) What can I say \u2013 it was just hilarious. So many conversations I have had with my sister in my life have gone that way.\r\n\r\nThe color she brings with her weirdness is fantastic. I wish all of you at some point have an individual in your lives that brings \u201cdifferent\u201d into your reality, whatever side of the spectrum you are on. I am very lucky to have it- and I\u2019m fairly confident my sister thinks I am ridiculous. Sometimes I think that to her, I am the \u201cdifferent\u201d!\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and go Broncos.\r\n\r\nMindy\r\nDenver, Colorado\r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 12]]
