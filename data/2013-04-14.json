["[The Listserve] Happy Birthday", "Dana Morrissey", "Blake,\r\n\r\nEven with this weird opportunity to send a message to 21,422 people, I\u2019d rather just send you a birthday note. So, listen up:\r\n\r\nYou are f$%&ing awesome.\r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s been a pretty weird (weird = kind of crappy and also legitimately weird) year for you, but you\u2019re less than a week away from a fresh start.\r\n\r\nLast year you:\r\n\r\nTook a paid sabbatical.\r\nTried stand up comedy.\r\nRealized stand up comedy was not your jam and tried writing funny stuff instead.\r\nWrote funny stuff.\r\nHelped a lot of vets.\r\nStopped being a vegan.\r\nBecame one of my best friends.\r\n\r\nThis year you will:\r\n\r\nRealize that you are f$%&ing awesome.\r\nTry improv comedy.\r\nTell someone exactly why he or she should hire you and believe it.\r\nTell your dumb boss exactly what you think (at least once).\r\nTeach someone else how to be a great friend who does things like sending text messages at 8:25 AM on Monday mornings that say \u201cHere\u2019s to a good week!\u201d even though you know it won\u2019t be.\r\nRe-read Fierce Invalids and learn something new about Switters.\r\n\r\nI know you will.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with improv - first class on Daniel and me. We\u2019re signing you up for Level One with Armando on April 27th. Happy Birthday!\r\n\r\nCheers to you, your big heart, your ridiculous giggle, your brave and lonely feminism, and your eerie way of knowing what\u2019s right - always.\r\n\r\nWith my heart,\r\n\r\nDana\r\nNew York, NY\r\ndana.l.morrissey@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.s. Sorry about that Oxford comma, I always get confused when there are so many \"and-s\" around.\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 14]]
