["[The Listserve] A Whole Lot of Somethings, or Nothings", "Jenna", "What I want to get most out of my ListServe opportunity is the chance to connect, so feel free to contact me with whatever\u2019s on your mind (maybe read the rest of this before you do, though...).\r\n\r\nI wanted to write something unique and intriguing, of course, but I\u2019m rarely that creative. Probably tomorrow I\u2019ll think of something fascinating I should have written. There\u2019s a writing \u2018experiment\u2019 further in. My introduction is at the end because it is typical and boring.\r\n\r\nTry sunflower butter with honey on rye toast.\r\n\r\nI intended the bulk of this e-mail to be about Tolkien and YouTube (as two separate topics, though now I wonder if there are any good Tolkien-focused YouTube channels?), but I really don\u2019t know what to say about Tolkien other than I am utterly fascinated and enamoured with his creation of Middle-Earth and all that relates to it (I\u2019m going to Oxford at the end of August as a kind of pilgrimage). I have a bit more to say about YouTube.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m always fascinated when people don\u2019t understand YouTube in the same way I do \u2013 thinking it\u2019s just for how to guides, silly clips or music videos. I wonder how many of you understand YouTube in this way? I hope you\u2019d be impressed by amount of original quality content created for YouTube by ordinary people, and the communities that grow around that content. I would love for more people to experience this world. Hard to describe with words, just check out some YouTubers instead \u2013 for \u2018beginners\u2019 I recommend kickthepj and charlieissocoollike. For something a little different, check out hexachordal. (Yes, they\u2019re all popular British male YouTubers but off the top of my head I think they\u2019re a good start). There\u2019s a fantastic series running now called Becoming YouTube; I\u2019m not sure how interesting it would be for someone who\u2019s not already engaged with YouTube but you could check it out.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, shout out to Alan Lastufka, who doesn\u2019t know me, but I\u2019ve been a fan since fiveawesomeguys and he was how I found out about the Listserve.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll get no sage life advice or wisdom garnered through travelling from me, but here are some lyrics to keep in mind (\u201cShow Starts Now\u201d by Cloud Cult; Craig\u2019s words help keep things in perspective):\r\n\r\nHold your breath for a better day and you\u2019ll never learn to breathe\r\nYou\u2019re afraid of the dark but that\u2019s where you learn to see\r\nYou\u2019re no good to the living if you\u2019re too afraid to bleed\r\nThat\u2019s why your show starts now\r\n\r\nMessage me (be patient for a reply) if the following is relevant to you, or if you want to know more:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Tolkien fan\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Summer in the City\r\n\r\n\u00b7         WWOOF\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Writing as a personal activity\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Music (particularly Depeche Mode/Cloud Cult/AFP/Tom Milsom/Orphaned Land)\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Books (particularly Helen Oyeyemi/Cornelia Funke/Haruki Murakami/Catherynne M. Valente)\r\n\r\nSince I wanted to include some type of interactive writing experiment, send me a piece of your writing and I\u2019ll reinterpret/expand and send it back. Ask and I\u2019ll send you a piece of mine.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m yet another Listserve participant who can\u2019t believe they were chosen, can\u2019t belive the timing, and isn\u2019t at all prepared. I left my home on the Canadian prairies to WWOOF in Ireland on June 9, the most extreme experience in my life so far.  I find myself placed me in a position where, for the first time in my life, I have no easy internet access and very little time to spend on the computer. I am writing this in the three hours before it is due.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenna\t\r\ncr2jg@mymts.net \t\r\nNear Bantry, County Cork, Ireland (home in Manitoba, Canada)\r\n\r\n", [2013, 7, 6]]
