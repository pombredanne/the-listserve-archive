["[The Listserve] Everyday is a Restart Day", "Megan Quinn", "Hi everyone,\r\nToday I\u2019m taking a mental health day.  At least, that\u2019s what I call them.  Sometimes I need a break.  Especially at this time of the year, because it\u2019s the end of the semester and I have so much to do and I haven\u2019t been eating as healthy as I could or exercising as much as I like or sleeping as much as I need.\r\nI\u2019m an ambitious, busy, independent person.  It\u2019s really hard for me to admit that I need breaks.  But I\u2019m admitting it to all 13,226 of you (yes, I just checked) because I want you to feel okay about it admitting it, too.   Taking the time out to recharge your batteries is often very productive \u2013 it gives you the clear mind and the energy you need to tackle your next great project.\r\nI have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow, and the day afterward.  I have a hundred things I want to do in the near future.  But today, I need a break, and I\u2019m doing the things that make me feel healthy and happy.  Before I go out and conquer the world or something.\r\nBefore I go, a really fantastic high school student asked me to tell you this: \u201cEveryday is a Restart Day.\u201d  Today, I\u2019m restarting \u2013 I\u2019m eating well, exercising, and getting a full night\u2019s rest before I embark on tomorrow\u2019s journey.  And that is perfectly okay.\r\n\r\nMegan Quinn\r\nNew York City\r\nmegelizquinn@gmail.com\r\n\r\n", [2012, 5, 3]]
