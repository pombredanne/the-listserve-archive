["[The Listserve] Do I Know You?", "Ellen Bautista", "Some Degree of Separation \u2013\r\n\r\nLet's try this. By reaching out to total strangers, would we find a known connection within a minimal number of links?\r\n\r\nBelow are some info related to me. Do any of them ring a bell to you? Or know anyone who just might? Do email me your related info, if any, or send my email to someone you think may be interested. It's really just a way of finding out if long-lost acquaintances, friends, relatives or friends of friends are just a few email threads away. Don't worry; I have no intention of spamming anyone. I loathe those things. (And yes, there's always Facebook to search for people, but wouldn't this be fun too?)\r\n\r\nThese are random information about me or related to people close to me:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Arayat Pampanga\r\n\u2022 Fabie Estate Paco\r\n\u2022 University of Santo Tomas\r\n\u2022 City University Bellevue 1999\r\n\u2022 The AdPlanet\r\n\u2022 Veronica Ellen Bautista\r\n\u2022 Far East Bank and Trust Company\r\n\u2022 Supreme Court of The Philippines\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and to Listserve for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nEllen Bautista\r\nellen_b@me.com\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n", [2013, 8, 16]]
