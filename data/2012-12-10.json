To be completely honest with you, when I found out that I got to write one of these emails, I thought to myself, \u201cHow can I profit off of this?\u201d  Well, my paypal account is the same as my email address, so if you want to throw me a couple of dollars, it would be an easy way for you to make a broke college kid\u2019s day.  I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ll probably (definitely) spend it on pizza and beer, but damn if I won\u2019t enjoy it.  And if you\u2019re curious as to how much money I\u2019ve made from strangers, or anything else about me, just ask and I\u2019ll tell you!\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Hamilton\t\r\ndhamilt9@u.rochester.edu\t\r\nRochester, NY / Newton, MA\r\n\r\nP.S.  I run a 25:25 8k.  Can\u2019t resist the opportunity to brag to 20000+ complete strangers.\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 10]]
