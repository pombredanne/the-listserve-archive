["[The Listserve] The Clean Fiend", "Kieran", "Everyone has advice to give, mine is this: Do what makes your life happy, even if its just 5 minutes a day.\r\n\r\nAnd to support that cause, I want to pass along a story that my wife has written. 600 words isn\u2019t much, so here is half a story - email me back and I will send along the rest of it! She is working on a book and has other stories already published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clean Fiend\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on, Ted, just try a bite. It\u2019s not going to kill you. I mean, come on, you\u2019re already dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s so\u2026unhygienic. We don\u2019t even know where that has been. Just think of all the slimy, unsanitary cesspools in this city. Besides, you\u2019re touching it and I know for a fact that you haven\u2019t washed your hands in over a month.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy hands are mostly bone and tendon at this point. What\u2019s to wash?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSee, thinking like that just aids in the spread of unsavory diseases. Here, I have an antibacterial spray\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut-\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Ted. Just\u2026no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so resistant to the idea of basic hygiene. I can only imagine the number of creepy bacterium living inside of you right now. It\u2019s just, ugh, it\u2019s just too vile to contemplate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t point that at me!\u201d\r\n\r\n \u201cJust let me spritz you on this bit of entrail at least. It can\u2019t be healthy for it to just drag along the ground like that. Or, actually, wait, I think I have some plastic wrap that\u2019ll-\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTed! Stop it. Jesus! First off, that\u2019s horribly invasive. Leave my intestines alone. Secondly, it\u2019s the style, you know. Everyone\u2019s doing it. It helps trip up the fleshies and, you know, it looks cool. Eva digs it. At least, I think she does. She lost her jaw the other week so it\u2019s hard for her to talk now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally? Eva? The waitress from Bodie\u2019s Buffet on 3rd?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one and only, man. The one and only.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t her type? Because I distinctly remember you asking her out when we went there on New Years before all of this started and she said-\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what she said, Ted! But she\u2019s gotten to know me now. We\u2019ve been seeing each other pretty steadily over at Bodie\u2019s. He\u2019s still serving up the buffet. Well, the menu has changed a bit, but you know\u2026 Stop looking at me like that, man! She\u2019s totally into me. I can tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sure this has nothing to do with the fact that personal standards might lessen with advanced decomposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat kind of tone is totally unnecessary, dude. I\u2019m just trying to\u2026 Okay, look, this isn\u2019t about me! This is about your completely neurotic refusal to eat and all of this weirdo germ phobia crap. I mean, what self-respecting zombie carries around a fanny pack of sanitized baby wipes? I mean, seriously!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, I have a legitimate concern. If more people were conscientious about the spread of bacteria none of this would have happened in the first place. And by \u2018people\u2019, I mean you! I still remember waking up to you chewing on my leg. That was definitely a violation of trust!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAw, come on, Ted. How many times do I have to apologize for that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many\u2026How many times do you have to apologize for turning me into the rotting undead? Do you seriously have to ask that?\u201d\r\n\r\n~*~\r\n\r\nAuthor: A.
