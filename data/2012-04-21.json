["[The Listserve] Blossom", "Emily", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She was sick of it all.\u00a0 Sick of the contradictions, sick of the distance, and most of all, sick of the silence that ricocheted back and forth across her ear drums, more deafening than a collapsing building.\u00a0 Polite conversation, with its one-worded banter laced in falsity, could be tolerated.\u00a0 But the silence between them was painful.\u00a0 She wondered what had happened to their relationship.\u00a0 At one point they had been much more than just roommates; they had been best friends.\u00a0 They knew things about each other that no one else knew, and they shared secrets that ranged from romance to regrets, from insecurities to ideologies.\u00a0 Their close friendship had helped make the transition from small towns to college life easier for the both of them.\u00a0 Although they had differing personalities, they seemed to complement each other.\u00a0 But, most importantly, they had trusted each other.\u00a0 Recently, all of that had disappeared without warning.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it was time to leave, she didn\u2019t say that she was heading to class.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t want to interrupt the silence, an invisible yet unforgivable barrier that had formed between them.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t owe an explanation for her departure, and she knew she wouldn\u2019t have received a response anyway.\u00a0 Besides, she was sick of trying.\u00a0 She forced her work into a tattered backpack, stuffing notebooks filled with messy, looping handwriting and elaborate margin doodles in between a handful of novels and a laptop.\u00a0 Hoisting the bag over her shoulder, she pulled a battered iPod out of her pocket, inserted the small headphones into her ears, and pressed play.\u00a0 She breathed a sigh of relief.\u00a0 Though it was temporary, her music allowed her to escape from the silence that smothered her.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her class started at 2 o\u2019clock, but her dorm was a good distance away from the English building, so she left at exactly 1:30.\u00a0 She decided to take a bus halfway and then walk the remainder, allowing her to be one of the first to class but still giving her the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful sunny day.\u00a0 The afternoon temperature was unusually warm, and the day seemed to belong in May instead of February.\u00a0 This unexpected heat wave baffled the local weathermen, but it thrilled the students.\u00a0 As she stood at the bus stop, she noticed a few tan, bikini-clad girls were lounging on beach towels outside of her dorm.\u00a0 Several drivers stared at them as they drove by.\u00a0 The bus pulled up next to her, and she felt a familiar rush of warm air graze her cheek.\u00a0 She realized she was sweating.\u00a0 She greeted the bus driver, courteously taking her headphones out of her ears and making eye-contact.\u00a0 An old man with a beard smiled at her, and she smiled back and sat next to him.\u00a0 She fiddled with her iPod, which she had put on Shuffle mode, listening to each song for about five seconds until she changed it, briefly moving from soft jazz to classic rock to hip hop in a rhythmic pace.\u00a0 Her musical taste was eclectic, to say the least, much like her personality.\u00a0 She refused to associate with one particular stereotype.\u00a0 Instead, she dabbled in each one with no notions of stylistic identity, wearing what she liked and listening to what she wanted.\u00a0 Each song, no matter its genre, represented something to her.\u00a0 Sometimes it reminded her of an old friend or a past memory, while other times the bass line just seemed to reflect her mood.\u00a0 She let her emotions choose the song, letting her thumb repeatedly press the \u201cnext\u201d button while she stared out the window.\u00a0 Finally, she settled on a fast-paced, top-40 track that reminded her of high school, a track that she used to listen to with her friends while they drove around town with the stereo turned up and the windows rolled down.\u00a0 It was a track of innocent love, something she had once experienced.\u00a0 She had forgotten how it felt, but after the first few lines she could feel her heart beating along to the familiar melody of the chords.\u00a0 She thought back to that time and briefly admired how much simpler life had been then.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The song abruptly changed to one with repetitious bass pounding and loud, heavy guitar riffs.\u00a0 She quickly forgot of her past, as the nostalgia of blissful immaturity faded away, immediately replaced with the new track\u2019s rapid lyrics. She silently tapped her foot to the pulsating beat.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver lurched to a stop just as a guitar screeched in her ears, and she held on to the pole next to her to prevent herself from being thrown forward.\u00a0 She grabbed her bag, squeezed out from the area that encased her tiny seat, and carefully stepped off the bus onto the pavement and headed toward class.\u00a0 She walked slowly, admiring the way the bright sun shone through the naked trees, trees that weren\u2019t ready to bloom and probably wouldn\u2019t be ready for a few months, if that.\u00a0 The winter had been abnormally harsh that year, and it was predicted that the trees would probably bloom later than normal as a result.\u00a0 The vivid, recent image of the trees covered in snow sprang into her mind, and she realized a week ago, she had to wear a winter coat and gloves while walking to class.\u00a0 Now, it was forty degrees warmer and anyone wearing a coat would be scalding.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She briefly glanced at the people she passed by.\u00a0 Class had just gotten out, so the pathways were crowded.\u00a0 Several groups of rowdy boys walked past, describing their drunken hook-ups from the previous weekend and rambunctiously slapping each other on the back.\u00a0 They were all dressed similarly, wearing khaki shorts and pastel-colored polo shirts, their dark hair sticking out from underneath backward baseball caps.\u00a0 They were tall and handsome, and they all seemed to have similar features.\u00a0 Their collective good-looks repulsed her.\u00a0 There was no variety; they were all the same.\u00a0 Next to them walked large packs of girls, most of them blond and tan with thin, dainty physiques.\u00a0 Some of them wore brightly colored sundresses.\u00a0 Others wore tennis shoes and running shorts, though their neatly combed back hair and flawlessly applied make-up gave no indication of exercise.\u00a0 They were all beautiful, but they blended together, no one face standing out amongst the others.\u00a0 In the beginning of the school year, she had envied their apparent mass perfection.\u00a0 She began dressing up to go to class and started wearing makeup.\u00a0 Though she rarely wore earrings, she began to stick pearls into her ears every day, regardless of her outfit.\u00a0 She even abandoned her tomboyish wardrobe and occasionally wore dresses or skirts.\u00a0 But, soon enough, she got sick of it.\u00a0 She grew sick of waking up early every morning to straighten her hair, to put together a perfectly matching outfit.\u00a0 She grew sick of pretending to be someone she was not just to fit into a crowd of people that she did not resemble in the slightest.\u00a0 Instead, she forced herself apart from her classmates.\u00a0 She gradually got used to the fraternity boys looking right through her, as if she didn\u2019t exist, and to the girls in class talking to each other but not to her.\u00a0 She watched them converse as they walked past, but her music pounded in her ears, preventing her from hearing them.\u00a0 As she walked, she noticed that she was the only one wearing jeans.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked down at her iPod as she approached the building, checking the time.\u00a0 About ten minutes early.\u00a0 Not too bad.\u00a0 She systematically entered the building, walked down three flights of stairs, took a left, then a right, then a left again.\u00a0 Before entering, she turned off her music, wrapped up the headphones carefully, and put the iPod into her pocket.\u00a0 Then she entered, just like always.\u00a0 The only difference was that, this time, she was standing in a room of emptiness.\u00a0 The light was off, and the lack of windows made her feel as if she were standing in a cave instead of a classroom.\u00a0 It was completely silent, apart from the humming of a computer that sat in the corner, its screensaver a series of random twists and turns that filled the screen with color.\u00a0 This computer was the only source of light, and the screensaver\u2019s colors faintly shined across the room onto the wall.\u00a0 A technological rainbow.\u00a0 She was mildly surprised at the unexpected abyss she was standing in.\u00a0 Even though she was ten minutes early, she was never the first one to class.\u00a0 She felt as if she were trespassing, even though she was in the right place.\u00a0 She watched as the computer went into sleep mode, the screen blackening like the room around her.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She considered waiting outside in the hallway for someone else to arrive, but she decided to turn on the light switch next to the door instead.\u00a0 She went and sat down in her usual seat.\u00a0 The song she had just been listening to was repeating itself inside of her head; she quietly hummed and tapped her foot to the rhythm.\u00a0 Out of boredom, she pulled out one of her worn notebooks, its pages nearly filled up even though the semester had only started a month or two ago, and finished a doodle she had drawn of a man that had popped into her head but probably didn\u2019t actually exist.\u00a0 She shaded his cheekbones with a stubby pencil, drew then erased then redrew his thick eyebrows, and lightly added eyelashes to his bright, wide eyes that seemed to be staring directly at her.\u00a0 His lips were turned slightly upward in a mischievous half grin, as if he knew something about her that no one else did.\u00a0 Once she was satisfied with her finished sketch, she awoke from her artistic trance and realized that she was still alone.\u00a0 She turned on her iPod and glanced at the clock.\u00a0 3:02.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confused and suddenly worried that she was in the wrong room, she opened the door and looked at the room number.\u00a0 It was then that she noticed the blue post-it on the door.\u00a0 \u201cNo class today.\u00a0 Office hours will be held as usual tomorrow.\u00a0 Sorry for any inconvenience.\u201d\u00a0 While most students would probably celebrate this cancelation, she felt empty, as empty as the room she was standing in.\u00a0 Instead of the interaction she longed for, even if it was forced, she was once again thrust into an abnormal solitude.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She walked down the hallway and joined the throng of people walking home.\u00a0 Although she was submersed by the crowd, she still seemed to be set apart from them somehow.\u00a0 She turned on her iPod and inserted her headphones to escape from the nothingness that surrounded her.\u00a0 Here, she was the queen of her own world, a world with only one citizen.\u00a0 Her world made sense; it was one of sound and song.\u00a0 The bass drum of her heartbeat set the 4/4 rhythm and her footsteps pounded along in harmonized reverberation.\u00a0 This beat was steady and calming, unlike the confusion that she felt as she glanced at the people that passed her by. She watched the crowd around her as their lips moved, almost synchronized, but no sound came out.\u00a0 Concentrating intently on the rhythm that surrounded her, she looked ahead at the trees in the distance.\u00a0 The sun brightened their bare, crooked limbs, and though it was still early in the year, she saw what looked to be a single white blossom slowly emerging to greet the unfamiliar sun.\u00a0 Her smile bloomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily\r\nVirginia\r\n\r\n", [2012, 4, 21]]
