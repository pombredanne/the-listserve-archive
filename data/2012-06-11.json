["[The Listserve] A little bit about me", "James Pharaoh", "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am going to have to write this quickly because I am really busy! My flatmate and I are organising a Eurovision party and people will be arriving any minute. Check out wikipedia if you don't know what that is.\r\n\r\nMy name is James and I am English. I live in Barcelona which I love. Some people say I'm lucky to live here but anyone can do it if they want, it just takes determination and a little bit of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI've not had a Eurovision party before but I think it will be fun, if a little camp! I recently moved into a new flat and have done a lot of work to make it a home. It's nice to be able to enjoy it with my friends.\r\n\r\nI'm feeling very happy at the moment. Maybe partly because the weather is good and I can spend time on the beach. Work is going well and I am getting on well with my friends. I certainly didn't feel so happy during the winter, but then it always makes me a bit depressed.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is I find it harder to eat well and have put on a couple of pounds. It is definitely worth the sacrifice!\r\n\r\nI guess the only thing missing is \"that special someone\", I hope I'll meet them soon. Maybe I already have.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake care, \r\nJames x \r\nSaturday 26 May 2011 \r\nBarcelona, Spain\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 11]]
