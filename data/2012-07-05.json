["[The Listserve] we are a product of our own insecurities", "realistmister", "Don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t be one of those love yourself emails\u2026although you should be doing that already.  I would like introduce myself as Mr. Realist.  I am not particularly religious, I just believe in things I see.  I believe in capitalism and have encountered enough people to see that most people act in their own self-interest.  I am not a hater or a pessimist; again, I am just a realist.\r\n\r\nSo how did I get this way?  I am not sure.  There are so many questions, yet so little time to find the answers.  I don\u2019t understand many things but I am intensely curious.  Many people I come across rather know nothing and be happy rather than to know everything and be slightly bitter.  It is hard for me to understand this but as always, I respect the viewpoint.  Why not try to understand the world for all its intricacies?\r\n\r\nI love life.  I am privileged to work and live in a very progressive environment.  It is mind bending to think how far we have come as a society in such short period of time.  We are tolerant and accepting as a majority, but then again, I live in a bubble.  Individuality is ripping from the seams of conformity.  We are breaking into our own unique mold, yet unite as a whole.\r\n\r\nAs far as parting advice, be honest to yourself and be honest to others.  Surround yourself with people that love and support you.\r\n\r\nLove always,\r\n\r\nMr. R\r\nrealistmister@gmail.com\r\nSilicon Valley, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 5]]
