["[The Listserve] A New Career", "Dolores Yates", "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm 40 years old and I was hoping someone could help me. I'm at a time in my life where I just don't know what to do. I wish to have a better job, a better paying job. But I was foolish and never went to college. I think I'd make a great nurse, but I can't afford to go back full time, and going at night would take about 6 or so years. \r\n\r\nI make about $30,000 a year. It's an okay amount, but I can't take care of myself. What would happen if my husband got sick and no longer could work? What would happen if we divorced? \r\n\r\nI push paper around. It's so boring. It's the same thing every day. \r\n\r\nWhat are some positions I could look into that pay a bit more? I am now making an amount that I think is the most a company would be willing to pay me without additional schooling. \r\n\r\nWhat are some careers I could learn in 2 years including prereqs? A 2 year program at night would probably be around 4 years... \r\n\r\nI find that all the research I've done is misleading. I read I can become a nurse in 2 years... but then I read you must already have an associates degree. So then it's 4 years, which would take me 6 years or more to complete.\r\n\r\nDolores Yates\r\ndoyatii@gmail.com\r\nEast Coast, USA\r\n", [2013, 8, 12]]
