["[The Listserve] Stay hungry, stay foolish", "Ujala Ali Khan", "Hi! I\u2019m a 32-year-old Karachi girl living in Dubai. I dance a lot, even though I\u2019m terrible at it. But that\u2019s ok, because I\u2019d rather be bad at doing something I enjoy, than be good at doing something I hate.\r\n\r\nI believe life is too short to spend doing things - or being with people - you don\u2019t really like. So just focus your energy on the people and things that you love.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to work for a living, but not live for working. With the exception of the lucky few who have found a way to make money doing something they truly love and enjoy, most of us work fulltime jobs just to make ends meet, and there\u2019s nothing wrong in admitting that. So come in to work on time and leave on time, and enjoy real life.\r\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people say, money is not evil. Money is great. It gives you the freedom to do as much or as little as you want, for yourself and for others. It gives you the power to help other people. It gives you the luxury of exploring your own self. So don\u2019t be embarrassed to admit that you love money. I sure do!\r\n\r\n\u201cStay hungry, stay foolish\u201d are four words have been quoted ad nauseam, but I believe that better advice has never been dispensed in fewer words.\r\n\r\nI also believe that is no such thing as \u201cThe One\u201d. The power for someone to be The One resides not in them, but in you. It can be whoever you want it to be, or it can be no one.\r\n\r\nBut once you find someone you love and who loves you back, hold on to them. Fight like mad dogs if you have to, but also kiss and make up. Because no matter how bad things get, if you have a shoulder to rest your head on and a hand to wipe your tears, you will get through it.\r\n\r\nLove and light,\r\n\r\n\r\nUjala Ali Khan\r\nUjala_far@yahoo.com\r\nDubai, UAE\r\n\r\n", [2012, 10, 12]]
