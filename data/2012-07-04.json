["[The Listserve] TCZA", "Mylissa Fitzsimmons", "Today is the perfect day to eat ice cream for breakfast. Gather your family for a dance party in the kitchen. Take a road trip to the mountains for a picnic. Sing your favorite song at the top of your lungs while you air guitar naked in front of the mirror.\u00a0Today is someone's birthday, call them and sing Happy Birthday them. They deserve something more special then a Facebook comment. Invite your friends over for \u00a0cocktails and\u00a0karaoke.\u00a0Build a fort with your kids in the back yard. Tell them about the moon and explore the stars. Live your life with many mistakes and no regrets. Never join the grown ups. The world will laugh at you. The trick is to laugh first and laugh the loudest. And tonight as you sit around your dining room table with your family or friends tell them you love them. Because the zombie\u00a0apocalypse is coming and.... you are going to have to kill them.\r\n\r\nMylissa Fitzsimmons\r\nmylissabird@gmail.com\r\nLos Angeles, California\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 4]]
