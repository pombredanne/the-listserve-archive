["[The Listserve] A quote and a joke", "Anonymous", "Once a friend told me, \"o godz--the building across the street just grew a proboscis.\"\r\n\r\nIt was construction season in Boston.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTwo mathematicians, Joe and Bob, are in a restaurant.  Joe is talking about how he feels that math education has really improved in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nBob is a grumpy old man.  He disagrees.  Strongly.\r\n\r\nJoe says, \"You know, I bet the average person on the street even knows a little calculus.\"  Bob laughs.\r\n\r\nBob goes to the bathroom.  While he's gone, Joe calls their waitress over and tells her: \"Listen, I'm going to ask you to come over here in about five minutes.  When you do, I'll ask you a question.  I want you to answer \"One-third x cubed.\" If you do, I'll leave an extra $5 in the tip.\"\r\n\r\nThe waitress blinks at him.  \"One thir-dex cue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, close enough.\"\r\n\r\nBob comes back from the bathroom and Joe says, \"Look, I'll bet our waitress knows the integral of x squared.\"\r\n\r\nBob scoffs.  Joe bets him $10.\r\n\r\nThey call the waitress over and Joe asks her the integral of x squared.  As instructed, she answers \"One third x cubed\".\r\n\r\nAnd as she's walking away, she calls back over her shoulder, \"plus a constant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous \r\nBoston, MA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 4]]
