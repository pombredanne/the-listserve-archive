["[The Listserve] Advice from a College Misfit", "Emilia", "Hola, people! My name\u2019s Emilia. Psychology student. Intrepid author, archer, singer, fencer, guitarist, language lover (any German or Spanish speakers here?), blogger, and bunny enthusiast.\r\nIf you could tell the whole world something, what would you say? I want to give a tiny little piece of advice: be a little crazy. Be a misfit. Be bubbly and exuberant and just be yourself. Cherish everything. Keep track of every detail. Jump into someone\u2019s arms and let them spin you until your head is spinning (or, be the catcher and spinner of the person running at you). Compliment someone, dye your hair a crazy color, write some poetry. Take a chance, because damn it, you don\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try. Find inspiration from those around you, not celebrities. Make your own way in the world. And most importantly? Whoever and wherever you are, there is always an opportunity for your voice to be heard. Know that you\u2019re a good person. You\u2019re AMAZING, more so than you could ever believe \u2013 even if you never hear people say it. Be confident in yourself. You can change the world, people. Believe me, I\u2019ve done it in my own ways and seen the results. My roommate Mariah insisted that I include the quote, \u201ceverything will be alright in the end. If it\u2019s not alright, it\u2019s not the end.\u201d She said that would make you smile. I certainly hope it did, because the world is a better place even but for a single smirk (also, there are a bunch of positive side effects \u2013 but I\u2019m not here to go all psych major on you).\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\nEmilia =)\r\nAccidentalauthoress@gmail.com\r\nAlso, not to be that annoying girl who promotes her own stuff, but please check out my blog at blogs.fit.edu. It helps me to pay for college, yo!\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 15]]
