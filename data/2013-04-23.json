["[The Listserve] The Categorical Imperative.", "Kumar Lomash", "My life changed after reading about the categorical imperative. Do a google search and you will find lots of stuff. Start with the wikipedia article.\r\n\r\nOne concept that I really love is about freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom is not just the ability to do what you will (what you wish or want) but to be able to will, with nothing but pure reason\"\r\n\r\nWe always think about freedom in terms of what we *can* do. A bigger question is, if no body stops us, what will we do? And why? Think about it.\r\n\r\nBTW, New Delhi is getting hotter and hotter - it is almost 40 degrees centigrade today!\r\n\r\nBye, Lomash\r\n\r\n\r\nKumar Lomash\t \r\nkumar.lomash@gmail.com\t \r\nNoida, India\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 23]]
