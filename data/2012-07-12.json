["[The Listserve] Are you angry?", "Matt Haworth", "When I was young I was angry.\r\n\r\nSo much seemed to be wrong in so many parts of the world - I didn't know what to do, I just knew I wanted to do *something*.\r\n\r\nYet changing the system seemed impossible for millions to bring about, never mind one angry teenager.\r\n\r\n5 years ago, a small thought changed my life.\r\n\r\nI realised 'the system' - with its business, jobs and money - is not the problem. It's just a tool.\r\n\r\nMost use that tool to prosper regardless of their impact on others - but you don't have to.\r\n\r\nI started a business that finds ways to use the web - something I knew a lot about - to improve lives.\r\n\r\nWe make a profit so we can pay fair wages, and reinvest what\u2019s left into doing more good.\r\n\r\nThis is a \u201csocial enterprise\u201d - it puts people, not profit, first. I think the world would be better if every business were replaced with one.\r\n\r\nI'm not noble or brave enough to give everything I have to charity - or to fly to a more needy country to lend a hand. But every day I do a job that I know makes the world a little bit better instead of a little more unfair.\r\n\r\nI'll never make much money from it.\r\n\r\nBut I feel rich - and a whole lot less angry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt\r\nyou.should.email.matt@gmail.com\r\nManchester, UK\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 12]]
