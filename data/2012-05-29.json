["[The Listserve] From the bottom of the world", "Mike", "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm from somewhere far away.\r\nApparently, I live in the most remote city with a population in excess\r\nof one million people.\r\n\r\nHello from Auckland, New Zealand.\r\n\r\nI don't feel very far away from you. I think we probably have a few\r\nthings in common.\r\nI live and breathe and work and sleep and eat and love.\r\nI read this list email every day and I hope for a glimmer of\r\ninspiration from others.\r\nI struggle with depression and anxiety and stress and worry. Some days\r\nI feel like every day is a battle.\r\nSome days, it is a battle for me just to get out of bed.\r\n\r\nBut today feels like a good day. I told myself this morning when I\r\nwoke up that it would be a good day.\r\nAnd here we are. It's a good day. The sun still shines. I chose for\r\ntoday to be a good day.\r\n\r\nYou choose your path. You're the one who decides what can happen to\r\nyou and if you'll let it happen to you.\r\nI feel like I need to remind myself of this more often.\r\n\r\nI'll finish with a quote I liked from Ralph W. Emerson\r\n\r\nWhat lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared\r\nto what lies within us.\r\n\r\n\r\nKia Kaha,\r\nMike\r\nmike@nothing.net.nz\r\nAuckland, New Zealand / Aotearoa\r\n\r\n", [2012, 5, 29]]
