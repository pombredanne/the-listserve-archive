["[The Listserve] choosing poopy diapers over football and hotrods", "Andrew Reynolds", "Wow, best I can tell from a few quick searches of my past saved Listserve emails, I appear to be the first one selected from the great state of Alabama.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame that that the most dominating College Football state of the past 4 years hasn\u2019t been represented yet. (3 Championships from Alabama, 1 from Auburn).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got to admit, moving back to the state I grew up in on the verge the Crimson Tide\u2019s collegiate dominance couldn\u2019t have been any better timed.\r\n\r\nAfter staying a true fan through a decade+ of up and down seasons (mostly down) it is nice to be on top again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate last year I purchased a 1934 Ford Coupe fiberglass project car.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m really excited to be working on something like this, even though I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing.Luckily for me my father-in-law does.  If any of you have tips on previous hot rod projects you\u2019ve worked on I\u2019d love to hear them.If you\u2019re interested in selling some hot rod parts, I may be interested in those too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI work in IT at one of the top 5 largest U.S. colleges based on enrollment.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy my job as a Data Analyst and I love having the ability to sift through millions of records of apparent random data and know what to do to turn it into powerful information.\r\n\r\nThen, being able to see that information used to drive meaningful decisions to help the university move towards their strategic goals is an even bigger bonus!\r\n\r\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned dealing with large amounts of data is that there are almost always exceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\nEveryone may think that a certain scenario couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t happen but until you look at the data, you don\u2019t know for sure.\r\n\r\nI feel this has also made me a skeptic in real life too though. I find myself committing to fewer statements until I have definitive proof that I\u2019m picking the right option.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if this makes me a good worker, a super nerd, or a boring person with no hobbies (before I bought my car) but if I\u2019ve got nothing to do one night I like being able to work on fun projects from work outside of normal business hours without the constant interruptions of email and instant messages slowing me down. I feel so much more productive.  Working full-time from home has also enlightened me to the amount of wasted time I had when I worked in an office setting going to and from meetings and constantly being pulled into side-conversations as people come in and out of the office.  I do miss the personal interaction though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2011 my wife and I had our first child and it really is amazing how kids change your perspective on life.  I\u2019m still a huge Alabama fan, technology nerd, and aspiring hot-rodder, but none of that really matters when compared to being able to spend quality time with your family.  I hate when I realize that I\u2019ve let something distract me and take away time I should have spent with them.  As kids become toddlers and really start learning, it is amazing watching them pick up on new things.  No one can make me truly laugh like my little girl can and nothing makes me prouder when she learns something new (especially if I taught her!).\r\n\r\nIf you want to check out the perspective of raising a kid from a father\u2019s viewpoint check out my brother-in-law\u2019s blog by googling \u201cdadabase blogger\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Reynolds\t\r\ndrew2300@gmail.com\t\r\nNortheast Alabama, USA\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 28]]
