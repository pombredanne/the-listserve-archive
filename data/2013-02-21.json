["[The Listserve] Advice", "Dave", "I live in a country where entire sections of bookstores are dedicated to advice or self-improvement. Hell, in the late 90s we had a Billboard hit that was just an inspirational high-school graduation speech over a drum beat.\r\n\r\nSo there is nothing I can say here that hasn't already been said. But, the winter wind howling outside my windows reminds me of one of my favorite poems, so I'll leave you with that.\r\n\r\n Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening \r\nby Robert Frost \r\nFirst published in New Hampshire in 1923   \r\n\r\nWhose woods these are I think I know. \r\nHis house is in the village, though; \r\nHe will not see me stopping here \r\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\r\n\r\nMy little horse must think it's queer \r\nTo stop without a farmhouse near \r\nBetween the woods and frozen lake \r\nThe darkest evening of the year.\r\n\r\nHe gives his harness bells a shake \r\nTo ask if there's some mistake. \r\nThe only other sound's the sweep \r\nOf easy wind and downy flake.\r\n\r\nThe woods are lovely, dark, and deep, \r\nBut I have promises to keep, \r\nAnd miles to go before I sleep, \r\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity,\r\n\r\n\r\nDave\t \r\nwilkeson@gmail.com\t \r\nUpstate, NY\r\n\r\n", [2013, 2, 21]]
