["[The Listserve] Life & Pizza", "Shea B.", "Every single one of us is going to be worm food in a hundred years, so have fun while you're here and try not to worry so much.\r\n\r\nThis used to scare the shit out of me, but we've been dead for the last 14 billion years and have had no objection to that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, here is a recipe for a salt and pepper deep dish pizza crust which I love to make almost every week.\r\n\r\n========================\r\n\r\n2 c warm water\r\n4 1/2 tsp yeast\r\n1/2c vegetable oil\r\n4 tbsp olive oil\r\n1/2 c cornmeal\r\n5 1/2 c flour\r\n1/4 c potato flour\r\n\r\n2 tsp salt\r\n2 tsp pepper (if you don't want the salt pepper crust, use 1 tsp salt and no pepper)\r\n\r\nTime to finish: 4.5 hours\r\nTime where you're actively working on the pizza: 1.5 hours\r\n\r\n4.5 hours before you eat\r\n\r\nFill a medium bowl with the 2 cups of water, mix / disolve the yeast into the water. Add the olive oil, vegetable oil, cornmeal, and half the wheat flour. Beat for about 10 minutes. Add the potato flour, the remaining wheat flour, and the salt and pepper. Lightly grease a bowl at least twice as large as the dough, place dough in the bowl, and cover with damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for at least 3 hours. Punch down the dough at least 3 times over this time.\r\n\r\n1.5 hours before\r\n\r\nPut the pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and turn the oven to the max temperature.\r\nPrepare sauce / toppings.\r\n\r\n1 hour before\r\n\r\nRoll out dough to about 1/2 cm thick to fit in deepdish pizza pan. There will be leftover dough, put it in the freezer or cook another pizza. Lightly oil deepdish pizza pan and put dough in it.\r\nAdd sauce / toppings.\r\n\r\n30 min before\r\n\r\nLower the temperature to 450 F. Once it reaches 450, cook the pizza in the pan, on the stone, until the top is brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and get it off the pan and onto a rack by using a metal spatula to lift one crust of the pizza over the lip of the pan. With the stone still in the oven, increase the temperature to the max again. After the pizza has been on the rack for ~4 minutes, remove the stone from the oven and place the pizza onto the stone. After the pizza has been on the stone for ~5 minutes, remove from the stone, and its ready to eat!\r\n\r\n\r\nShea B.\r\nAustin, TX\r\n\r\n", [2012, 5, 7]]
