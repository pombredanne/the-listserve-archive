["[The Listserve] Tell me about your favourite book", "David Triendl", "My New Year's resolution for 2013 is to read 52 books in 2013 - one book\r\nevery\r\nweek. I have only picked the first book so far: \"Winter's Tale\" by Mark\r\nHelprin. It is my favourite book, but I have only read it in German. Now\r\nI want\r\nto read it in English for the first time.\r\n\r\nFor the remaining 51 books I would like for people on this list to send\r\nme\r\ntheir favourite books along with a short description. I'll start:\r\n\r\n    Winter's Tale is set in a fantastic version of New York City around\r\n    the\r\n    20th century. There is a great wall of clouds, in which time and\r\n    space seem\r\n    to work differently. There is a white horse, which jumps so far that\r\n    it\r\n    starts to fly. A beautiful but terminally ill girl which has\r\n    uncovered the\r\n    secret formulas of the universe. And a thief who is on the run from\r\n    his\r\n    gang, which he betrayed. All their fates are interwined in this\r\n    magical\r\n    story spanning a whole century.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to send me suggestions from any genre - I want to\r\nbroaden my\r\nreading horizon. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Triendl\t\r\ndavid@triendl.name\r\nZirl, Austria\r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 7]]
