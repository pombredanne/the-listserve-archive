["[The Listserve] Worry Less, Do More", "Kris Noble", "It's often said that the biggest obstacles we face in life are the ones we put up for ourselves. Unnecessary worry is one of those.\r\n\r\nHow many times have you denied yourself an opportunity because of worry - maybe you felt like you weren't ready, or that you didn't deserve something enough?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to that question is \u201cnever\u201d then you're very lucky indeed but most people  have held themselves back on many an occasion. Personally, towards the end of last year I was holding myself back to the point where I was hardly doing anything new or creative, stuck in a self-imposed rut.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying we should try to never worry about anything, because it's perfectly natural to worry sometimes, and certain things in life will always cause anxiety.\r\n\r\nWhat's important is to learn to realise when we're worrying unnecessarily and devise strategies for dealing with it in a productive way.\r\n\r\nThose strategies will be unique to you, so you'll have to work them out yourself. It's really easy though \u2013 all you need to do is take a little \u201cquiet time\u201d whenever you feel worried, frame your worry into a statement and then come up with a logical solution.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\u201cI'm worried that if I go for a job interview I might mess it up and make myself look stupid\u201d\r\nStrategy: \u201cSo I will make sure I'm fully prepared for my interview and perhaps roleplay with a friend so I can practise\u201d\r\n\r\nQuite often I find that just turning a vague worry into a definitive statement makes the solution obvious.\r\n\r\nOf course, sometimes you really aren't ready for that new job, or physically fit enough to run that marathon \u2013 but at least this way you have some kind of action plan.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the hang of dealing with minor worries in this way, you should find that you'll spend less time thinking about doing stuff, and more time actually doing stuff.\r\n\r\nYou won't always succeed, but if you're worrying less and doing more, failure is just a side effect of all the awesome new things you're experiencing rather than a crushing defeat.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, I hope you'll join me in worrying less and doing more! I'd love to hear about your thoughts and experiences so please get in touch :)\r\n\r\n\r\nKris Noble\r\nkrisnoble@gmail.com\r\nLondon, UK\r\n\r\n", [2012, 5, 28]]
