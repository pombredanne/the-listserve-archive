["[The Listserve] A Chase.", "Matt Konrad", "I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to wish you each a very happy New Year; may it present you with all of the joy, love and opportunities you hope for.\r\n\r\nOn with the show.\r\n\r\nThis is a portion of a fiction work in (very, very early) progress, and I hope it makes you all want to read more; follow me @mattjkonrad to find out if I ever finish the damn thing.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSaturday, July 4\r\n\r\nThe first fireworks exploded over the Mississippi as I ran through the alley behind my own house. I didn\u2019t know the exact intentions of the man chasing me, but the gun and the yelling and the broken window he\u2019d left at Elise\u2019s place led me to believe that he wasn\u2019t trying to return misdelivered mail.\r\n\r\nAs another fiery bloom took shape over the water, I paused for a split second to check on his progress. Just before the BOOM, I caught a glimpse of him silhouetted in red, exuding anger even though I couldn\u2019t see his face. As the light faded, he turned toward my back porch, and I swore to myself; I\u2019d been hoping to steal into my house and figure out what the hell to do next, but if he was heading that way, my plans were going to have to change.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw him passing my house with a single disinterested look, his eyes focused on the corners and the exits.\r\n\r\nShit.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019d seen me. My plans were going to have to change fast.\r\n\r\nFortunately, my small scraggly side yard butted up against an auto repair shop, and I knew where there was a flap in the fence. The head mechanic had cut it out last summer so his wife\u2019s unlovable pair of yap-dogs could sneak out and shit on my property instead, and I figured I was well within my rights to use it myself. I made my way to the appropriate section of fence, hoping against hope that the grand finale wasn\u2019t in the offing; I crouched, pushed the corner, and wriggled onto their asphalt, leaving nothing but a big heaping pile of my dignity behind, and opening onto a lot of lousy options.\r\n\r\nThe expanse of parking lot between me and the garage was exposed, well-lit against thieves and undoubtedly covered by some kind of alarm; I was about as likely to be able cross Lake Ponchartrain in my t-shirt and jeans. I could have potentially made a sprint for the little front office, but it was about the size of a phone booth, and I didn\u2019t relish standing in a shooting gallery.\r\n\r\nI figured my best chance at hiding was the line of cars just to my left. There were four or five in various states of disrepair and they weren\u2019t all that opaque, but I could get behind them in a couple strides and reassess what had gone wrong with my life.\r\n\r\nAnd so I took a deep breath, mentally measured the distance to the beat-to-hell green Camry closest to me, closed my eyes and tried to steel the shaking in my knees long enough to walk over without my teeth chattering and giving me away.\r\n\r\nIt took four steps. Each one of them seemed to last a damn eternity, but the only explosions that punctuated the sultry New Orleans night were those from the fireworks display. As I settled in behind the Camry\u2019s wheel well, nothing shot yet but my nerves, I had to laugh to myself.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d had a lot of lousy rebound relationships. But this was the first one that was about to get me killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt Konrad\t\r\nmjkonrad@gmail.com\t\r\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 30]]
