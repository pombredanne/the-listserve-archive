["[The Listserve] don't give up on someone who's bipolar", "Nando Casinelli", "I wasn\u2019t as excited as I thought I would be when I received the email from the Listserve that I had won the lottery to send out a story to thousands of people. I thought about it. I took an hour lunch break away from my cube, made a phone call and took a quick car ride around the block before I realized this was a chance to become another spokesperson in a drowned-out pool of mentally ill awareness advocates. But there can never be enough champions for the mentally ill.\r\n\r\nI, myself, am bipolar. I was diagnosed two years ago after living with the illness since I was 19 years old. It was only when I walked onto a beige tile floor in a pair of hospital socks to a room full of doctors that I was told the diagnosis. I had a bipolar episode and was admitted to a mental unit in the city public hospital. I always knew something was wrong, and although no one wants to hear they\u2019re bipolar, it was a relief to hear an answer to all the pain I had been dealing with.\r\n\r\nAfter I was released from the hospital, I didn\u2019t know how I would pick up the pieces to my life again. This being my fifth or sixth episode, I already knew how hard it would be. I moved out of the house I bought, into my parents\u2019 home. My ex-girlfriend, who I put through years of hell, was gone - her and the dog. How could I blame her, someone who had to deal with someone like me - someone with bipolar - every day to not leave me after all those years of craziness? Alienating the ones you love is always those most painful part of being bipolar. The aftermath is worse.\r\n\r\nSo what exactly is bipolar? It\u2019s different for everyone, but from my experience and what I\u2019ve been told, it\u2019s a mental illness that causes periods of emotional up\u2019s and down\u2019s, manic states \u2013 euphoric highs and an out of control state-of-mind - depressive states, uncontrollable actions, and a ton of other ill-fated effects. Coincidentally, those with bipolar have a hard time keeping jobs and relationships, among many other things. Sounds like it could ruin anyone\u2019s life, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nBut you learn how to manage the best you can as you go along with the right help and love. You\u2019ll constantly have to apologize and clean up all the messes you make when you\u2019re bipolar. I\u2019ve done it many times since diagnosis. I\u2019ve even lost another person that I dearly love. You\u2019ll feel comfortable enough to decide it\u2019s okay to stop taking your medication and/or see your doctors when you\u2019re bipolar. I\u2019ve also done this. Again. And you\u2019ll go to hell and back and back again when you\u2019re bipolar.\r\n\r\nThis is my chance to bring awareness to the mental illness that is bipolar. To bring it to light, so those that don\u2019t know about the struggles of someone with bipolar will understand them with compassion, patience, and most importantly love. It takes a sincerely loving person to become a bipolar\u2019s person loving martyr and partner. And they exist. I would know.\r\n\r\nThank you, and I\u2019m sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNando Casinelli\t\r\nnando.casinelli@gmail.com\t\r\nConnecticut\r\n\r\n", [2013, 7, 19]]
