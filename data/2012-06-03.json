["[The Listserve] Sundry thoughts", "Sunaina", "I'm generally not big on quoting other people, and maybe this is totally cheesy, but this poem contains what I find to be useful pointers on how to go about life. It's not clever, it doesn't rhyme, it's not grandiose. It's eloquent and on point:\r\n\r\nDesiderata\r\nGo placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.\r\n\r\nIf you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\r\n\r\nExercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\r\n\r\nNurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.\r\n\r\nTherefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams; it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.\r\n\r\nStrive to be happy.\r\n\r\n--Max Ehrmann, 1927\r\n\r\n\r\nSunaina\r\nlanainer@gmail.com\r\nSan Francisco, CA\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 3]]
