["[The Listserve] Tooting Your Own Horn", "Connor Tomas O\u2019Brien", "One of the guidelines for posting here is that you can\u2019t write anything too self-promotional. I suspect most of us struggle with figuring out when exactly it\u2019s right to toot our own horns. Nobody wants to be that guy or girl: the shameless self-publicist, the human spambot. And yet, sometimes we do create great work that we\u2019d like others to know about \u2013 what then? How do we decide when our work is good enough, important enough, to warrant puffing up our chests and shouting about it?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been working on a creative project with a small team for over a year now, and a few months ago we stepped back and realised we were done. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but we knew we couldn\u2019t hold off much longer: it was time to launch it into the world.\r\n\r\nWe immediately found ourselves stuck, with no idea how to get the word out without feeling silly or boastful. We\u2019re all introverts and prone to self-deprecation. We\u2019re not used to saying, \u201cHey, everyone, look over here! What we\u2019ve done is pretty amazing!\u201d We could see flaws in our work and could see where it was lacking. We were acutely aware that our project wasn\u2019t going to save lives or leave anybody slack-jawed in wonderment. So we decided to postpone the launch and keep tweaking. Tweaking was easier. Less scary.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, a friend of mine has been working on his novel for years. Every six months or so, he\u2019ll retrieve it from inside a deeply-nested folder on his hard drive and spend the next two months re-drafting it. When he\u2019s done, he\u2019ll leave it for six months and redraft it again. I suspect he feels uncomfortable taking the next step and pitching it to a publisher because there\u2019s already so much great writing out there, and he\u2019s wary of appearing arrogant.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that there are a lot of us out there: those that maybe should be talking our work up more, should be properly launching the projects we\u2019ve worked hard on, and should be more comfortable marketing the stuff we\u2019ve created. It\u2019s a shame that, in some cases, those who are most comfortable with self-marketing are those without anything interesting to promote in the first place. Meanwhile, some of the greatest living artists and thinkers are right now almost certainly working in obscurity, lacking the confidence or the platform to show the world what they\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\nFor those of us that aren\u2019t prone to shouting about ourselves, we risk being drowned out by those that can and do. The presumption is that if you don\u2019t say anything, you don\u2019t have anything to say, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily work that way. Those that are quiet are sometimes just waiting for a gap in the conversation. They\u2019re waiting to be invited to speak.\r\n\r\nWith all this said, I\u2019ve got a tiny little speck of an idea. I\u2019d love to hear what you guys have created or are working on \u2013 especially those of you who aren\u2019t usually comfortable promoting your work. If you send me a short paragraph about a creative project you\u2019re working on, I\u2019ll compile them on my blog (same domain as my email address) for all of you other Listservers to take a peek at.\r\n\r\nWe need more opportunities for the quieter amongst us \u2013 those less prone to chest-puffery \u2013 to tell the world about ourselves, our achievements, our stories, and our insights. I\u2019m glad that the Listserve exists for exactly that reason.\r\n\r\nYou guys are all wonderful, by the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nConnor Tomas O\u2019Brien\t\r\nconnor@connortomas.com\t\r\nAdelaide, Australia\r\n\r\n", [2013, 6, 24]]
