["[The Listserve] Three Ways to Be A Better Person", "Jess Moore", "I'll keep it brief because I tend to not read the long ones.\r\n\r\nFrom the legendary farmer and real food activist, Joel Salatin:\r\n\r\n1. Get involved.\r\n2. Read widely.\r\n3. Come home.\r\n\r\nDo these three things and I think you'll have a better chance of being happy, content, and creating meaningful relationships. It's working for me.\r\n\r\nTo hear more from the interview where Joel talks about those things, you can just Google \"Bulletproof Exec podcast #29\" and the specific part is at the 57:30 mark.\r\n\r\nBe well.\r\n\r\nJess Moore\r\nmoorestile@gmail.com\r\nWorthington, OH\r\n\r\n", [2013, 8, 23]]
