["[The Listserve] Goodness is up to you", "Claire McConnell", "Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a great battle, whether it is apparent or not.\r\n\r\nAnd whenever you're feeling down, drink a big glass of water or bake some chocolate chip cookies.\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n\r\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\r\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\r\n1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature\r\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\r\n1 cup packed light-brown sugar\r\n1 teaspoon salt\r\n2 teaspoons orange extract\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n2 large eggs\r\n2 cups (about 12 ounces) semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside. In a separate bowl with a wooden spoon, combine the butter with both sugars; mix until light and fluffy. Add the salt, orange, vanilla, and eggs. Mix thoroughly and then add flour mixture. Most importantly - stir in the chocolate chips!\r\n\r\nDrop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with tin foil or parchment paper.\r\n\r\nBake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nClaire McConnell\t\r\nclairemcconnell.ls@gmail.com\t\r\nSan Francisco, CA\r\n\r\n", [2013, 6, 27]]
