["[The Listserve] I am but a bug.", "David Matters", "Hello:\r\n\r\nAs this is 'the list serve'; I will 'serve a list'.\r\n* I'm a 42 year old, legally blind, stay at home dad.\r\n* I am: funny, intelligent, open-minded, creative, memorable, anal, logical, and a survivalist.\r\n* 'And' should only be used in numbers with a fraction or decimal; e.g. two thousand twelve, NOT two thousand and twelve.\r\n* 'Saw', i.e. the past tense of 'see', happens once, and is done. I saw the shooting star last night. 'Seen' is the past participle, and requires an auxiliary verb, e.g. has, have, had. 'Seen' is something that is more than once, or continuing. I have seen shooting stars every night this week.\r\n* People 'lie', e.g. I lie on my bed to read. To 'lay' something requires an object. I lay my book on the nightstand before going to sleep.\r\n* I love my wife, Lenora, and my children: Simone, Malakki, and Terra.\r\n* Men are not all (created) equal. They should, however, have equal consideration and opportunities.\r\n* Like yourself. If you don't, others won't either.\r\n* Have you ever stopped to think ... and never started again?\r\n* Objects and concepts (guns, drugs, religion, etc.) are neither good nor evil. There use defines the evil.\r\n* Hope for the best, plan for the worst.\r\n* I welcome comments, insights, insults, queries, or suggestions.\r\n\r\nBe excellent to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Matters\u2026\r\nmorzorak@hotmail.com\r\nKansas City, MO, USA, North America, Earth, Sol System, Milky Way Galaxy\r\n\r\n", [2012, 10, 26]]
