["[The Listserve] Kindness is the King", "Sean Manton", "Dear fellow Listservians ~\r\n\r\nHere is a poem I wrote recently, and now I wish to share it with you:\r\n\r\nKindness is The King.\r\nMay you let it rule your Kingdom.\r\nGloriously!\r\nIn spite of all those Dragons\r\nThat aim to break your Heart.\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing your thoughts with me. I always look forward to reading what you have to say. I hope that peace may find you wherever you go.\r\n\r\n\r\nSean Manton \r\nseanpatrickmanton@yahoo.com\r\nToronto, ON Canada \r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 20]]
