["[The Listserve] The simple secret to surviving India", "Arthur Cheysson", "You just landed in India. You\u2019re a bit stressed: it\u2019s absolutely normal. But let me just tell you a simple thing, and everything will go just fine. In a matter of days, the Indian in you will be fully awakened.\r\n\r\nThe head tilt.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple gesture: just tip your head from side to side with a small angle (around 15\u00b0), repeatedly. Don\u2019t make it start at the top of the head; your chin should be driving the movement. Limit yourself to three or four tilts, in a fluid movement. Got it? Yes, you\u2019re doing it right.\r\n\r\nYou just learnt the secret to Indian communication. A stranger is talking to you in an unknown language? Just concur, using your newly learnt skill. Congratulations! You successfully communicated. Look at the visible satisfaction in your new friend\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nHuh? You still don\u2019t understand what it means? You\u2019re puzzled by this taxi driver\u2019s use of the gesture when you give your destination? Was it \u201cyes\u201d, was it \u201cno\u201d?\r\n\r\nNo, you\u2019re not getting it: it doesn\u2019t have a meaning, because it IS the language. Does English have a meaning?\r\n\r\nBut the comparison with English stops here. The tilt head is much more powerful. What other language allows you to communicate \u201cI reluctantly agree to the price you have given me, but be aware you get all my contempt\u201d with such concision?\r\n\r\nWarning: Excessive use of the tilt head may severely impair your communication skills back at home. Use at your own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nArthur Cheysson\r\narthur@cheysson.fr\r\nNew Delhi, India\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 2]]
