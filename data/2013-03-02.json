["[The Listserve] Sunrise in Lake Michigan", "Vincent Yu", "It's around 30\u00baF (-1 \u00baC) in Chicago right now. We just saw the first substantial snow of the new year and as a kid who grew up in West Coast suburbia, I never would have imagined myself saying, \"I have come to appreciate everything that the city of Chicago offers.\" These include:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1.\tWearing boots, scarves and gloves. Now when I watch television,\u00a0movies, and my West Coast friends wear any such accessories to look fashionable, I've gained the assumptive habit of chuckling.\r\n   2.\t'Checking the weather' involves more than opening your window in a city that shines in the morning, snows in the afternoon and rains at night (if you're lucky, in that order).\r\n   3.\tAppreciate food from pizza to kimchi pork belly fries\u00a0to what I think is the best vegetarian food I've ever had (a seitan reuben in a vegan diner).\r\n   4.\tLove schizophrenic/varied architecture forms from \"cold, utilitarian\" modernism, to Asian-influenced,\u00a0prairie-style living, to buildings in the Untouchables, and\u00a0Wilco album covers.\r\n   5.\tComprehend\u00a0what it means for a public schools system with over 110,000 students a year to have 6 of every 100 students earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 25\r\n   6.\tLearned what it really means to have\u00a0'gang violence'\u00a0[I highly recommend this paper\u00a0for anybody interested in the\u00a0institutionalization\u00a0of modern gangs].\u00a0\r\n   7.\tUnderstood that many urban, big-city issues do not emerge as individual human failure or corruption per se, but simply institutional failure\u2014failures of scale: our police, our local companies, our education system, our local government, our local media. These issues at large transcend so many supposedly 'correct' political/popular theories. For example, it is incredibly difficult to creditWilliam Bratton, COMPSTAT and Broken Windows theory for the success of NY crime decline, when the actual crime began falling several years prior\u00a0throughout the US\r\n   8.\tGrown to appreciate sunrises on\u00a0Lake Michigan\r\n\r\n\r\nBut really more than\u00a0anything, I've learned to appreciate being uncomfortable. I found this quote to\u00a0express\u00a0what I mean:\u00a0 \"To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted.\u00a0// Bill Bryson\" and more than anything I am incredibly grateful of the opportunity I've had uprooting all of my childhood comforts towards starting something new, difficult and just different.\r\n\r\n\r\nVincent Yu\t\r\nvincenty@gmail.com\t\r\nChicago, IL\r\n\r\n", [2013, 3, 2]]
