["[The Listserve] \"This old curiosity shop of a world\"", "Emily Wolfteich", "I\u2019m Emily and I\u2019m newly 21 and celebrated my birthday in Paris next to Canal St. Martin. Things about me\u2014no one can pronounce my last name; my hair might be red or might be blonde but it\u2019s definitely curly; I say y\u2019all; I have a brother and a sister, of whom I am fiercely proud.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m from DC, but have been working in Paris, first with an association that works with African immigrants who have HIV/AIDS. I expected to cry at that job, or to feel pleasantly selfless, but instead I realized the obvious fact that in some places, even Paris, a freckled American girl with a mostly-working knowledge of French doesn\u2019t quite do the trick. Once a man named Jean with a velvet voice tuned for the radio held my hand and cried because he could never go home, and I couldn\u2019t tell him in his own language that it would be okay, because I don\u2019t speak Wolof, and because I knew it wouldn\u2019t be.  Well, that gutted me.\r\n\r\nNow I work with the regional center for AIDS prevention and we talk to high schoolers about prevention and kindness. In some ways, this is easier \u2013 I have a rapport with them because of my age, my skin, how society sees me. But still, I\u2019m off to the side, I watch. Perhaps I do even less here.\r\n\r\nI could tell you love stories about Venice and harrowing tales of falling off rocks in Arizona, but I guess for this email I just couldn\u2019t decide which to tell. I want to live on a boat and I want to write beautifully or rawly, and I want to speak five languages but most of all I want to be brave and I want to make a difference, which is a hard thing to plan out.\r\n\r\nIf you want a 21 year old\u2019s advice, it would be to read Eduardo Galeano\u2019s Voices of Time, which is amazing; William Least Heat-Moon\u2019s Blue Highways; and Arturo Perez-Reverte\u2019s The Nautical Chart, which is a flawed book but still a lovely one.\r\n\r\nWhen William Least Heat-Moon interviewed Miz Alice on Tangier Island, she said \u201cSome people sit around and wait for the world to poke them. Right here in this old curiosity shop of a world, they say, \u2018Poke me, world.\u2019  Well, you have to keep the challenges coming. Make them up if necessary.\u201d As my mother says, \u201cSuck the marrow out of it.\u201d Adventure is out there.\r\n\r\nPlease write me because I\u2019d love that. Tell me who you are, how you live, and if you have advice for someone who hasn\u2019t yet come up with a genius plan to fix things. If you\u2019re in Paris, on peut prendre une verre; if you\u2019re in DC, let\u2019s hit up the Portrait Gallery courtyard; if you\u2019re elsewhere, see you soon?\r\n\r\nThe world is bright and black and disappointing but I swear it is never empty.\r\n\r\nI am Emily and I want to save the world and write about it, and I love meeting people, and like Hafiz, \u201cI wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing light of your own being.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily Wolfteich\t\r\nemily.wolfteich@gmail.com\t\r\nParis\r\n\r\nP.S. If quantum theory is correct, and there are parallel universes where all things that could have happened in our lives did happen, in at least one of them I\u2019d be in that bright kitchen in Venice with Luca and we\u2019d be making breakfast, and I would just like to say that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sad or wonderful that somewhere in space it\u2019s possible that we never lose anyone at all.\r\n\r\n", [2013, 7, 7]]
