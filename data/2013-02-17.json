["[The Listserve] What's the BIG IDEA?", "Jane Boatman Geller", "I adore illustrations. I am addicted to self help. I love that every day, I get the chance to create the life I want \u2013 a life of unlimited possibilities.\r\n\r\nOne day (way too long ago), I had a BIG IDEA.\r\n\r\nWhat if I combined the things I love into an online destination that I could experience daily to lift my spirits (ahhhhhh)\u2026 Inspire me (Yes, please! I would like that)\u2026 Remind me of my blessings (my children, my husband, my friends and my well worn home)\u2026 Instill gratitude in my life.\r\n\r\nI envisioned delicious illustrations \u2026self improvement \u2026 daily interaction! Maybe this could help others too! A place with a purpose\u2026 What a BIG IDEA.\r\n\r\nI adored my BIG IDEA.\r\n\r\nYet, as much as I loved it, I didn\u2019t act on it.\r\n\r\nMy BIG IDEA waited for me.\r\n\r\nI had a family to raise. A marriage, friends, a home and my own existing (and lovely!) growing business.\r\n\r\nOn vacations I would take out my BIG IDEA and play with it. Think about it. Plan. Daydream.\r\n\r\nYears went by.\r\n\r\nI signed up for The ListServe. \u201cOoooh! If I ever get picked, I will tell them all about my BIG IDEA!\u201d\r\n\r\nI had so many intentions. And my BIG IDEA just sat and continued to wait. I told my BIG IDEA, \u201cI will get to you soon. I haven\u2019t forgotten you. I am just too busy now.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Universe replied. Via email. Tag you are it. Sitting in my inbox: [The ListServe] You\u2019ve been selected.\r\n\r\nSuch an opportunity! 21,583+ subscribers!\r\n\r\nMy three daughters asked, \u201cWhy not tell them about your business, not the BIG IDEA\u2026 what about the business you have now?\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause my BIG IDEA has been so patient. It has waited long enough.\r\n\r\nMy BIG IDEA should have a launch party -- a Debutant Ball. My BIG IDEA deserves some love.\r\n\r\nSo without further ado\u2026 Today, for the first time, 21,583+ ListServe subscribers will be introduced to my BIG IDEA. (Drumroll, please!)\r\n\r\nI am proud and excited to unveil my BIG IDEA: The Good Life is Now\r\n\r\nThe Good Life is Now (TGLIN) is a delightful online destination \u2013the purpose is to connect you to YOURSELF and YOUR LIFE.\r\n\r\nIt is taking many of the mindset activities of positive psychology, spirituality and the science of happiness & well-being and delivering them in a visually delicious game type format in your own personal world.\r\n\r\nTGLIN speaks to BOTH what is good in your life now, while also helping you envision an inspired future.\r\n\r\nMy journey to create TGLIN is just beginning.\r\n\r\nI invite you to sign up online at The Good Life is Now if you would like to join me for the ride.
