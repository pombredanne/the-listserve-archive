["[The Listserve] Une jeune vie", "Brian Morrow", "20 years isn't a lot of time to live on this Earth. Given my age and relative experience I'd venture to say that any potential advice I have would be already known by the majority of readers. \r\n\r\nIn my spare time I do a lot of programming. I'm perpetually curious and voracious in my problem solving. I obsess. My addictive personality takes over more often than I'd like.\r\n\r\nThe day before Valentine's day I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years. He was 40. \r\n\r\nI'm fascinated by languages, both spoken and unspoken.\r\n\r\nSo far, this message has read like a pithy OkCupid profile. I'm interested in stories. I'm interested in hearing about experiences and opinions. I'm interested in pen-pals. \r\n\r\nShare your story with me and I'd be more than happy to share more of mine with you. Intimacy is something I have difficulty with. The Listserve seems an ideal place to begin getting over that. \r\n\r\nYou are loved. You are not alone and you are not worthless. And, neither am I.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----\r\nGCS d-- s+:+ a-- C++>$ UL++>++++ P+ L+++ !E(---) W+++ HN++ ?o ?K- w o- M+ ?V(-) PS++ PE Y+ PGP+ t- 5 DH X R- tv b++ DI+ D+ G++ e++ h++ r- y+(*)\r\n------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------\r\n\r\nBrian Morrow\r\n27514\r\nbmorrow92@gmail.com\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 17]]
