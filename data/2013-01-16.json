["[The Listserve] Hello World", "Jerry DIxon", "Hello out there.. My name is Jerry, and I\u2019ve been on the internet since it was just a series of tubes. I teach a bit, (Computers and Programming) and enjoy technology the way you might think.\r\n\r\nAs an \u201cEarly Adopter\u201d, I still have my Compaq \u201cLuggable\u201d that runs the CPM operating system. (Google it..)\r\n\r\nI just returned from the Consumer Electronics Show, (C.E.S.) and was able to see many exciting new products, most priced above my pay grade. (Way above in some cases.)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I have found over the years that anything you want can be achieved if you focus on it.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my topic is, \u201cLive Your Dreams, and They Will Come True\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis email arrived by way of my \u201cSpam Box\u201d even though the regular Listserve emails arrive unscathed. I\u2019m not a bitter guy, so I still responded to this \u201cWinners\u201d email even though it\u2019s past the 48 hour window.\r\n\r\nBest to you and yours.\r\n\r\nJerry Dixon\r\nHollywierd, CA.\r\njdmeister@dslextreme.com\r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 16]]
