["[The Listserve] Finish a project", "Trevor Johns", "Hello everyone,\r\nIt's an honor to be writing to all of you. I can't believe I've been picked so early on!\r\nI've been trying to figure out what to write about, and believe me\u2026 it's tough. Don't worry, I'll be brief.\r\n\r\nI have something I'd like you to do.\r\n\r\nThink about a project you've been wanting to finish \u2014 perhaps something important, or perhaps something small. And ask yourself\u2026 why haven't you done it yet?\r\n\r\nToday, I want you to put aside whatever's standing in your way. Finish that project. Even if it's not perfect, there's always time to fix things later.\r\n\r\nThe biggest barrier to success is often fear of failure. But that's okay\u2026 it's better to try often and fail, than to wait for perfection which will never come.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrevor Johns\r\ntrevor@tjohns.net\r\nSan Mateo, California, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 10]]
