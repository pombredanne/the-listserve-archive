["[The Listserve] The Morning After the Night Before", "Becki", "My cousin got married last night. She is the first among my generation to get married, so this is the first time in over a decade that this branch of the family has been all in one place. Right now many of the people I care most about are recovering in the next room. The ceremony was beautiful, the food was wonderful, and a 10PM noise ordinance means we will talk forever about the cops shuting down the DJ at the reception.\r\n\r\nSo here is my advice:\r\n\r\nLove your family. You don't always have to like them, but love them when you can.\r\n\r\nDon't stress the small stuff - it isn't a real party till the cops show up. (Or someone stomps off in a huff.)\r\n\r\nTravel - many of the guests (myself included) traveled 12+ hours to this party and not one person regrets a moment of it.\r\n\r\nLive in the moment - Grandma can\u2019t remember anything that happened 5 seconds ago, but she spent hours last night in her chair at the party watching everything. She had no idea what was happening or who was getting married but she was thrilled to be at the party.\r\n\r\nThat said, I hope you all have a chance to be as happy as I am right now. I have my family around me, beautiful vistas of the mountains of Tuscon outside the windows, and nothing to do but bask in the post-wedding serenity until my 7AM flight tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecki\t\r\nintrepidcat@gmail.com\t\r\nWashington DC\r\n\r\n", [2012, 9, 30]]
