["[The Listserve] Vatican run, Harrowing Hanoi and Farting Hippo", "Jordan Newman", "It\u2019s said that 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every single minute. Despite the site\u2019s massive size, I find that my relationship to YouTube is incredibly personal. Looking back at videos I have \u201cfavorited\u201d or clips I have filmed from low resolution smartphones provides a montage of meaningful moments in my life: that song that that somehow encapsulate my college years, that music video that transports me back to San Francisco, even that video a hippo letting out a massive fart. :) Each of these videos has special meaning for me\u2014whether they\u2019ve influenced the way I think, remind me of a specific time in my life or just make me smile.\r\n\r\nAt that end, I\u2019d like to share a couple videos that provide a window into my life in a way that 250 words never could.  If you\u2019re interested in taking a look, head to YouTube and search for them exactly as they\u2019re titled below. (My YouTube username is jnewman1986...lame I know). I hope you find meaning in these videos as well.\r\n\r\nThe Vatican Run: An epic adventure\r\nMy senior year of college I traveled to Italy with my closest friends. We awoke at the crack of dawn and we made our way to the Vatican. We sprinted through a maze of corridors (and the world\u2019s finest art) in an effort to be the first tourists in the Sistine Chapel.\r\n\r\nSony Bravia (Bouncy Balls)\r\nI moved to San Francisco when I graduated from college. This video of balls bouncing down one of the city\u2019s iconic hills was practically my only exposure to the city before I moved. Somehow the image of colorful balls cascading chaotically down a city street is an accurate metaphor for my time in SF.\r\n\r\nJordan's harrowing ride in Hanoi\r\nA couple years ago I traveled to Vietnam with my family. We took a pedicab ride through the chaos that is Hanoi, which has no discernable traffic laws that I could make out. Despite the pandemonium, the city is bound together by a chaotic harmony that I grew to love.\r\n\r\nNo Woman No Cry Ziggy, June 3rd\r\nImpromptu Ziggy Marley concert at a benefit I attended with my family on a summer night in Malibu. It\u2019s rare to find music that everyone in my family can enjoy. It\u2019s also rare for the entire family to be together and this night on the beach is one I will always remember.\r\n\r\n\r\nJordan Newman\r\njordan.listserve@gmail.com\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 7]]
