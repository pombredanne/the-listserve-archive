["[The Listserve] Time", "Chris Powell", "Try to imagine a life without timekeeping.\r\n\r\nYou probably can't. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays.\r\n\r\nMan alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers the paralysing fear that no other creatures endures. A fear of time running out.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChris Powell\t\r\ncap71@cam.ac.uk\t\r\nCambridge, UK\r\n\r\n", [2013, 6, 21]]
