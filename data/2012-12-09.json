["[The Listserve] Words", "Nadine", "I received the Listserve selection email the day I passed my test to become citizen of the U.S. I thought that\u2019d give me something to write about, but then I found myself sitting in front of a blank word document. Nothing. Which isn\u2019t to say I have nothing to express, but rather that I\u2019m not quite sure how.\r\n\r\nThis happens more often than it should. I\u2019m a college senior studying film and journalism; in essence, I\u2019m building myself up for a career of words, yet I often struggle to use them.\r\n\r\nSo instead, I\u2019d like to share some (rather random) words from others. Often when you don\u2019t know what to say, someone already has:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\n\r\nMaude: The earth is my body; my head is in the stars.\r\n\r\n[pause]\r\n\r\nMaude: Who said that, Harold?\r\n\r\nHarold: I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nMaude: Well, I suppose I did, then.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Maude, Harold and Maude\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMy drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.\u201d \u2014 The Little Prince\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \"Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?\" he asked. \"Begin at the beginning,\" the King said gravely, \"and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" \u2014 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAll writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.\u201d \u2014 George Orwell\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you write (journalism, screenwriting, or otherwise), please feel free to send me tips, advice, stories you've written. I\u2019d love to read them.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Nadine\t\r\nnadinelistserve@gmail.com\t\r\nPennsylvania\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 9]]
