["[The Listserve] \u201cOh god, I\u2019m so old.\u201d", "Bon Morrison", "I turned twenty-three last Friday and I now find myself at a bizarre crossroads in my life. I just hit the one-year mark of my first real career job. I\u2019m in the industry that I went to school for. I\u2019m sitting behind a desk inside an iconic building in Toronto where I schedule television shows for the largest Canadian television network. I have a salary, I have a benefit package, and I\u2019m doing well enough financially to support myself for the next few years.\r\n\r\nGetting back to that bizarre crossroads now \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m older than I actually am. I can\u2019t go on Facebook now without seeing people I know getting pregnant or getting engaged or also getting career jobs. It doesn\u2019t help though that this is counter-balanced by all the people on my Facebook that are still getting hammered every weekend and doing nothing with their lives. Who do you want to be, Bon?\r\n\r\n\u201cWhoo! Dranks with mah gurlz!\u201d\r\n\u201cCancun 2012!\u201d\r\n\r\nYou know what I mean.\r\n\r\nGetting down to the nitty-gritty, I\u2019m making a bold assumption that this is all stemming from the fact that I\u2019m single and actively want to be in a relationship. No more of this going out and getting laid business. I think I\u2019ve lost count of the amount of times I\u2019ve made the joke, \u201cWe get it! You\u2019re happy!\u201d whenever a couple walks by \u2013 unfortunately there\u2019s a half-truth buried in there somewhere. Truth be told, I haven\u2019t had a steady girlfriend in a few years. Keyword: Steady. I\u2019ve had a few \u201cgirlfriends\u201d the few years that have always been on-off-on-off but never one steady enough to actually say, \u201cYo, I\u2019m dating this girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I watch too many romantic comedies that star Ryan Gosling. Why can\u2019t I be Ryan Gosling? Give me the rain moment \u2013 I totally earned it. I\u2019ll totally renovate a house for you. Or I can pull that stunt from Love Actually where Andrew Lincoln shows up at Keira Knightley\u2019s door with cue cards. You know what I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t even lie. Now I just have to channel my inner Shane West in A Walk to Remember and name a star after my next girlfriend.\r\n\r\nWow, did I just write that last paragraph? Moving along.\r\n\r\nThis has played out like an overly long dating service video. It really isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not lying around going, \u201cWHY CAN\u2019T I FIND A GIRLFRIEND!?\u201d It takes second-fiddle to whatever is going on in my life at the moment that is infinitely more important.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve literally written this as a stream of conscious and know what I realized? I\u2019m twenty-three year old. I\u2019m not old at all. My life is so fun and I honestly couldn\u2019t care less that I\u2019m still single. I have a concert to go to tonight. I have two birthday parties next weekend. I have another two concerts the following weekend. And then it\u2019s the holidays.\r\n\r\nDid I say something about a crossroads earlier? Forget that. If anyone in the Toronto area wants to dance their heart out or have an evening of shuffling through my overly large collection of romantic comedies, let me know.\r\n\r\nI had to end it as if it was a dating service video, it was just too easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBon Morrison\r\nbon.c.chan@gmail.com\r\nToronto, Ontario\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 10]]
