["[The Listserve] You do you, boo boo", "Meagan Smith", "What's up and welcome,\r\n\r\nAs every Listserve member out there has, I've toyed with what would I\r\nwrite, well the time has come and now I'm undeniably overwhelmed.  I\r\nthink I always knew I wanted to put some piece of advice, not\r\nnecessarily assuming everyone would follow, but in the sense that this\r\npiece of advice was most helpful to me and it's my email, so let's do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut, before I get all \"self help book\" on you, I'll give you a little\r\nbackground.  I'm in my final year of college, and like everyone on\r\nthis earth, I'm incredibly busy.  Rather than listing my achievements,\r\nand having you gauge just how busy I am,  just know that if there was\r\na way to never sleep thus providing endless time, I'd be the first\r\nperson to sign up.   Biggest fear right now? I will graduate\r\nunemployed.  I'm terrified of not having a job.\r\n\r\nNow that I made myself relatable, let's get all advice-y.  In no way\r\nam I attempting to convince you of what you should or should not do,\r\nI'm just sayin' these things really stuck with me and have made a\r\ndifference.  If for no other reason, I'm just sharing my story, feel\r\nfree to think \"shove it\" and not take any of my words seriously...\r\n\r\nThe best piece of advice I ever received was during a big interview\r\nprocess I was going through, someone who had gone through it in years\r\nprior came up to me and said \"Don't worry about what everyone else is\r\ndoing- that's way too exhausting and will get in the way of you doing\r\nyour best\".  It really resonated with me and I try to apply this to my\r\neveryday life.\r\n\r\nI think I'm done now, because none of you have time or are\r\nparticularly interested in having me send some long email.  So with\r\nthis, I'll give a quick shout out to Tim S., he's  gem and a half and\r\nintroduced me to the Listserve.  If anyone in life is going to go\r\nextremely far, it's this kid.\r\n\r\nHave a great day and remember,\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter if the glass is half full or half empty, there's\r\nwater in the cup\" (Rudy Francisco)\r\n\r\n\r\nLater skaters,\r\n\r\nMeagan\r\nmegmonsterr@hotmail.com\r\nSan Luis Obispo, CA\r\n\r\n", [2013, 10, 18]]
