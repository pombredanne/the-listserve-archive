["[The Listserve] strong-ridged and deeply hollowed", "Malcolm Drenttel", "I have two requests of the Listserve\u2014\r\n\r\nFirst, I have been reading the listserve every day for a few months now, and I want to express my disillusion at what I've seen. Far too many of the messages I receive from the listserve spew the same clich\u00e9s that I have been listening to my whole life. Please, if you're given this gift, tell me a story, introduce me to your favorite musician, tell me about your startup, tell me a joke! Show me what makes you individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy second request is this: read more poetry.\r\n\r\nScheherazade\r\n\r\nTell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake\r\n                                         and dress them in warm clothes again.\r\n       How it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses running\r\nuntil they forget that they are horses.\r\n            It\u2019s not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,\r\n       it\u2019s more like a song on a policeman\u2019s radio,\r\n         how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days\r\nwere bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple\r\n                                                                       to slice into pieces.\r\nLook at the light through the windowpane. That means it\u2019s noon, that means\r\n        we\u2019re inconsolable.\r\n                            Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.\r\nThese, our bodies, possessed by light.\r\n                                                     Tell me we\u2019ll never get used to it.\r\n\r\n-Richard Siken\r\n\r\n\r\nMalcolm Drenttel\r\nmalcolmdrenttel@gmail.com\r\nNew Haven, CT\r\n\r\n", [2012, 10, 3]]
