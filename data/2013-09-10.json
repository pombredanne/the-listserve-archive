["[The Listserve] How Not To Make A Baby", "Joe Thompson", "It turns out getting pregnant isn\u2019t as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I have been trying to conceive for over five years, suffering one miscarriage and month after month of letdowns and discouragements.  Turns out we both bring our own specific biological issues that, when combined, compound the problem.\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m well aware that we are not the first couple to grapple with infertility and conception issues, this is one of those things where knowing you\u2019re not alone isn\u2019t always the most comforting thought.  Add to that the staggering amount of tips, suggestions, medical information, etc., it can get downright frustrating.\r\n\r\nWhen things don\u2019t work as they should, be it electronics, automobiles, or my reproductive system, it drives me crazy!  There\u2019s no real peace in the knowledge that there\u2019s nothing I can really do to cause my body to produce the correct amount of sperm.\r\n\r\nThere are options, of course, with adoption or in vitro fertilization leading the pack.  We\u2019re not opposed to either, although they\u2019re not exactly in our budgetary cards just yet.  If anyone can point Oprah our way, there\u2019s a high five with your name on it.  Honestly, the romantic idea of conceiving a child the \u201cold fashioned way,\u201d is just what our hearts are set on.\r\n\r\nThrough it all, hope has been both our strongest ally and greatest source of pain.  Each month, we carry the hope that this time, this month will be the one.  And each month, we feel like idealistic, optimistic fools, only to start the whole process over again.  Regardless, I worry about us losing that hope.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been working on and off on a blog about our experiences where, if nothing else, I\u2019ve found supportive and comforting folks who read and share.  We can share links, of course, so I\u2019m not sure if this makes it through, but you can find it by heading to howtomakebabiesdotwordpressdotcom.\r\n\r\n My wife and I are praying people, constantly covering this and seeking an answer.  There\u2019s a certain level of acceptance by now, but there\u2019s always hope.\r\n\r\nI think that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to leave off with\u2026there\u2019s always hope.  So many things can be denied or taken away in this world, but hope, though it may sting us at times, is what keeps us going.\r\n\r\nFeel free to drop me a line or look me up.  I\u2019m on Twitter: @jovid52,  where I share nonsense, music I\u2019m enjoying, television reviews, and stuff, but I\u2019d be happy to interact with ya!\r\n\r\nJoe Thompson\r\njovid052@gmail.com\r\n@jovid52\r\nDallas, Texas\r\n\r\n", [2013, 9, 10]]
