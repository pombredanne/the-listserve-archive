["[The Listserve] The Path With No Choices", "Mahar", "I was surprised when I finally got the chance to say something to you. I wrote this few years ago when I had an inner battle with my faith. You know, the kind of thing that makes you ponder why life sometimes can be so unfair. I hope this will answer the question you've been asking the Universe.\r\n\r\nFor these past few weeks, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot. I\u2019ve been trying to find reasons. Answers for my why(s). Then I came up with this :\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as free will. I never had a choice.\r\n\r\nEven if there is, They always leave me with cruel choices They force me to make. I never had a choice.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had my time thanking the Universe. I\u2019ve also had time blaming it on the Cosmic Irony. I\u2019ve been through anger and I\u2019ve also been to acceptance, back and forth. I got to the point where I could not go with this wandering-around-the-vicious-circle anymore.\r\n\r\nYesterday, it just occurred to me that I was wrong.\r\n\r\nChoices. Yes they have always been cruel. Of course They would never give us the easy way with choices.\r\n\r\nFree will. All this time, I\u2019ve been closing my eyes and choosing to not see the big picture. It\u2019s not about the choices or how cruel they are. It\u2019s about the way you see them. That\u2019s our free will. Choosing the way you see those cruel choices. It\u2019s either you keep bargaining and angry with it or just accept and be grateful, for in the end whatever choice we made, it would turn on a dime. Sure the journey will be tough. But you can make it less hard by seeing them differently now.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing you can do about those choices. It has to be made. Just believe that someday you\u2019ll thank Them for the cruel path They\u2019ve given to you for it helps you grow.\r\n\r\n\u201cValuable things have a way of being misunderstood in their own time.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants a quick fix, they always have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nMahar\r\nfierce.as.fire@gmail.com\r\nIndonesia\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 2]]
