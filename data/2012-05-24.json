["[The Listserve] Don't forget to have fun!", "Diogo Pires", "Hey! It's cold right here in Brazil! brrrrrr\r\nWell, I would like to share with you some things that I did recently and, somehow, changed my life:\r\n\r\nI quit my boring strategic consultant\u2019s life\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical year\r\nI discovered life (yeah! There's life between 9 am to 18 pm)\r\nI went skateboarding at Ibirapuera's Park (Sao Paulo) every afternoon\r\nI started studying Social Entrepreneurship\r\nI met new (and interesting, inspiring, innovating, brilliant, etc.) people\r\nI traveled to the most beautiful place in the world (Chapada Diamantina | Bahia | Brazil)\r\nI traveled to other countries\r\nI started swimming\r\nI started swimming and running\r\nI started swimming, running and mountain-biking\r\nI started cross-country triathlon competing\r\nI made new friends\r\nI met old friends\r\nI visited a slum\r\nI made friends at slums\r\nI changed my points of view - I found a new purpose for my life\r\nI started my own business\r\nI failed in my first own business\r\nI met more people - including my current business partners\r\nI work at a business that really cares with social and environmental issues\r\nI changed my eating habits - now I'd prefer organic foods\r\nI found love again\r\nI found a girlfriend that inspires me\r\nI found a girlfriend that I admire\r\nI hugged my mother, father and sister - and said many times that I love them\r\n\r\nAnd today... I feel myself lighter... I laugh every day... I'm in peace.\r\n\r\nThat's my suggestion to you... try to do things you'll never think you would do. Enjoy, learn more and don't forget the essential point: HAVE A LOT OF FUN!\r\n\r\n\r\nDiogo Pires\r\ndiogo.tpires@gmail.com\r\nSao Paulo, Brazil\r\n\r\n", [2012, 5, 24]]
