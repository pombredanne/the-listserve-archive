["[The Listserve] Italy baby!", "Seppe", "Hi Listserve\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat\u2019s up? I love hearing your stories, you know. I hope I\u2019ll be as entertaining as you have been.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFirst some words about me:\r\nI\u2019m a 30 years old/young guy & have an amazing girlfriend, who luckily also has become my wife since January of this year!\r\nWhen I say married, I mean a civil marriage, not a religious marriage. To be honest, I don\u2019t really understand why some people have a need to believe in something imaginative. In history, religion only has given us wars, disputes,try to control & influence their followers, .... Don\u2019t start about all the values it gives us. ;-) Those are just human values that some religions have considered their\u2019s, but in fact they are not. These values are culturally dependent human values. Nothing to do with religion if you\u2019d ask me. You know... the world would be such a better place when people stopped believing in those religions and started believing in themselves, their friends & their neighbours. What a fun world it would be!\r\nShe is also pregnant. My wife I mean, not the religion ;-) It\u2019ll be our first child, so it\u2019s kind of spooky, fun, scary & really cool; All at the same time :-)I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\r\nI\u2019m currently working as a marketeer for Coca-Cola & am \u00a0living in the centre of the world (?!?): Belgium.\r\nFor those who don\u2019t know Belgium, it is: Brussels / HQ of NATO & EU / Belgian fries (no they should not be called french fries!) / Belgian beers / Kim Clijsters / ...\r\nBy now, you probably know where Belgium is situated. ;-)\r\n\u00a0\r\nBelgium is a tiny country, but it is awesome. I love living here. I do admit that sometimes people complain too much, but I guess that is the same everywhere ;-)\r\nEven though it is a fun country, I\u2019m hoping to move, in a couple of years, to Sydney, Australia or Atlanta, USA. I already have lived in France & the UK and I love integrating in new cultures & getting to know them. Does anybody live in Atlanta & Sydney? Don\u2019t hesitate to give your views about these cities!\r\n\u00a0\r\nI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t believe me, but in 2 days I\u2019m leaving on a holiday which is aweseome. Yeaeaeaeaeaeaeaaah!!!\r\nI\u2019m going on a 3-week roadtrip with as an endgoal Tuscany/Umbria in Italy.I love travelling so much. Usually I only decide during the travelling where I\u2019m going, where I\u2019ll sleep, etc.\r\nIs somebody living there? Or has some good tips to visit there? Or where to sleep? Or what to do? I\u2019d love to get some out of the box ideas :-)\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut now, let\u2019s get serious. What is it actually that I\u2019d like to tell to you guys/girls:\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only do those things you love doing! Life is way too short to lose time doing this you\u2019re not passionate about!\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be passionate and by being so, make the people around you passionate!\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eat Nutella during breakfast (I do it every day). It\u2019s just too good & too tasty to miss out. ;-)\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf somebody is visiting Belgium, don\u2019t hesitate to let me know & I\u2019ll give you some tips or we\u2019ll have a (Belgian) beer together!\r\n\u00a0\r\nEnjoy life!\r\n\u00a0\r\nSeppe\r\nseppe82@hotmail.com\r\nLeuven (close to Brussels (which is in Belgium (which is a country in Europe)))\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 9, 3]]
