["[The Listserve] The Future Comes Soon Enough", "Melanie Renzulli", "There is so much I want to tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to tell you about love. I wish people were less scared to say \u201cI love you\u201d because more people need to hear that they are loved.\r\n\r\nI want to tell you about traveling and how it should be pursued early and often.\r\n\r\nI want to tell you about writing and how you should not fear your own words or thoughts, even though I will censor myself as I write this.\r\n\r\nI want to tell you about my life, my work, my dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to inspire you.\r\n\r\nI want to make you laugh.\r\n\r\nBut today, I am not feeling light. Summer, my favorite season, is nearly over. Acorns are falling. Some leaves are beginning to brown on their branches. Change is in the air.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the first day of second grade for my oldest son, an occasion that is both joyous and melancholy. I got up earlier than usual today, made breakfast, got him and his brother dressed in new clothes. They goofed off while I took photos of them standing by the flowering crepe myrtle in front of our house.\r\n\r\nThe younger brother\u2014aged four and three-quarters and still in preschool \u2014 wore sunglasses for the photos, just like last year. He\u2019s the confident one, he\u2019s the silly one. He\u2019s going to be the kid that holds court in the classroom, with guys and girls gathered \u2018round to hear his jokes and stories.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure what the future holds for my oldest boy, the one who has mild autism. He has been so excited for this day to come. School provides him a schedule; he craves routine. Still, as I left him this morning, he gave me a worried look. I couldn\u2019t hear him over the din of the other children in the cafeteria, but I could see him say, \u201cSee you at 3:30.\u201d He needed to know I would be there.\r\n\r\nEach school year means a new teacher, who may or may not know the best way to handle my son\u2019s idiosyncracies. There\u2019s also the concern of whether he will make friends \u2014 will other kids invite him to birthday parties and play dates? My son is well known at his current school thanks to his lovable nature, his precocious math skills, and his ability to memorize everything from people\u2019s birthdays to the exact length of nearly every song on my phone. Yet I know that as he ages, the chances of him being bullied for his differences will increase.\r\n\r\nMy family will be moving abroad next year, as we do every two to five years. While I am excited to introduce my sons to a new culture, the thought of starting from scratch \u2014 enrolling in a new school, finding new therapists, doctors, teachers, and caregivers \u2014 was enough to make me weep this morning. Maybe the new school will be wonderful and my son\u2019s new peers will be kind and understanding. I am hopeful it will all work out, but the prospect of starting over fills me with angst.\r\n\r\nAlbert Einstein once said, \u201cI never think of the future \u2014 it comes soon enough.\u201d The physicist for whom our local high school is named is also believed to have been on the autism spectrum. I doubt my son will be the next Einstein. But I do hope that he will find his calling; that he will excel despite (or because) of his quirks; and that one day soon when I have to walk away from him, he will give me a smile \u2014 a simple acknowledgement that he is not worried and will be fine on his own.\r\n\r\nMelanie Renzulli\r\nmel8twelve@gmail.com\r\n@melanierenzulli\r\nWashington, DC\r\n\r\n", [2013, 9, 1]]
