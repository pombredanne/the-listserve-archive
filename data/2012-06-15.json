["[The Listserve] Often, That Problem is Mine", "Cathleen Rittereiser", "My favorite English professor taught me to write like Hemingway.  Few words and active verbs make perfect sentences. \r\n\r\nSenior year, I had to write an essay, one conveying a sense of time and place, in the style of Joan Didion. Inspired by my respect for the professor and enthralled by Didion, I wrote a harshly honest account - my struggles with weight, food, responsibility - and anger at parental pressure. peer pressure and career pressure.   The title, \"Often, That Problem Is Mine,\"  referenced a joke between my friend Scott - also in the class - and me.  The totally awkward, poorly-constructed sentence summed up everything we wrote and thought about, while mocking the passive, unmanly writing styles we had certainly transcended.  \r\n\r\nMy professor gave me an A and encouraged me to publish it.  He seemed truly enthusiastic, convinced it would make a great op-ed in the New York Times.  \r\n\r\nLacking confidence, and still fearing parents' wrath, publishers' rejection and professional repudiation, I demurred, dodged and dropped the idea.\r\n\r\nI failed to follow-through, and now I wonder what might have been.\r\n\r\nOften, that problem is mine.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCathleen Rittereiser \r\ncathleen@cathleenritt.com \r\nNew York City  \r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 15]]
