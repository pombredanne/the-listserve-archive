["[The Listserve] There Once Was A Man From Nantucket...", "Paul Matthews", "This year is the bicentenary of Edward Lear's birth. He was an author and artist, responsible for The Owl And The Pussycat and the popularisation of limericks. His nonsense inspired me to become the person that I am, so in honour of that wonderfully silly man I thought I\u2019d inflict some homespun limericks upon you all...\r\n\r\nMy uncle is blessed with a nose\r\nThat\u2019s as crimson as any a rose\r\nIf you wait until night\r\nAnd then switch off the light\r\nYou would swear, in the dark, that it glows\r\n\r\nHave you heard of the cat on the mat\r\nHe was lazy and stubborn and fat\r\nWhen a mouse walked on by\r\nHe would open one eye\r\nAnd say \u201cSir, I refuse to touch that!\u201d\r\n\r\nYoung Jim would eat nothing but eggs\r\nWhich he pickled in large wooden kegs\r\nWhen each barrel was done\r\nHe would jump in for fun\r\nAnd the juices stripped hairs off his legs\r\n\r\nA buddhist was studying dharma\r\nAnd assessing his level of karma\r\nWith a shake of his head\r\nHe exclaimed \u201cWhen I\u2019m dead\r\nI am sure I\u2019ll come back as a llama\u201d\r\n\r\nOn a sunny day sometime in June\r\nI decided to go to the moon\r\nSo I made me a rocket\r\nFrom the foil in my pocket\r\nAnd I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll get there real soon\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nPaul Matthews\r\nmatthewskorea@gmail.com\r\nSeoul, South Korea\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 3]]
