["[The Listserve] (no subject)", "hellofauxreal", "Hello world!\r\n\r\nI just got the first Listserve email, and it was a little bit too similar to what I was originally going to send so I deleted my email and started again. I feel as though this is going to turn into a mass swapping of inspirational quotes for us to all live our lives by\u2026but hopefully it will vary more as time goes on.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to just share some secrets with you instead.\r\n\r\n1.      When no one is watching, I like to dance as if I\u2019m in a hip hop music video.\r\n\r\n2.      I haven\u2019t washed my hair for four days. Dry shampoo is one of my favourite inventions.\r\n\r\n3.      I\u2019ve always wanted to break my arm or leg. I don\u2019t want to really go through the pain, just ever since I was younger I\u2019ve been jealous of the slings and crutches involved.\r\n\r\n4.      I like Justin Bieber\u2019s new song\u2026 I don\u2019t want to and it pains me to say it, but I think I do.\r\n\r\n5. I GENUINELY (and irrationally) believe I\u2019m going to win the jackpot on the Euromillions Lottery one day. I know people always have the conversation about what they would buy if they won the lottery, speaking hypothetically, but in my head I\u2019m thinking.. \u201cgreat idea, you need to remember that for when you win\u201d. Having my email picked from this list just made me even more sure of it. Ridiculous, I know.\r\n\r\nHave a lovely day!\r\n\r\n\r\nhellofauxreal@gmail.com\r\nLondon, England\r\n\r\n", [2012, 4, 24]]
