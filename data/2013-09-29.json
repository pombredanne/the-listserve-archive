["[The Listserve] Photo request", "Taylor Lorenz", "I'm not sure I have anything to say, or wisdom to impart, but I was wondering if you might send me a photo?\r\n\r\nIt can be anything in your life. A pic of your daily commute, a photo from your favorite vacation, a picture you happened to take recently on your phone. \r\n\r\nI promise not to publish or utilize it in any way. I just want to know what your life is like. \r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor\r\ntaylor.lorenz@gmail.com\r\nBrooklyn, NY\r\n\r\n", [2013, 9, 29]]
