["[The Listserve] Random advice about Risk and \u201cRisk\u201d", "Meghan Callahan", "We\u2019re taught to fear \u201cthe stranger\u201d, but most sexual assaults are done by someone the victim knows. Most children will be assaulted by a relative or family friend, most women by an acquaintance. Teach your children to know a dangerous situation, rather than relying on \u201cstranger danger\u201d. Women should know that they are not necessarily safe when they are with people they know.\r\n\r\nConversely, enjoy the company of people around you. Do not approach everyone like they are a potential scam artist/thief/rapist/liar. Life is too short to view everyone as a suspect.\r\n\r\nIf someone has a weapon and says \u201cCome with me or I\u2019ll hurt you\u201d, DO NOT GO! Where you are is much safer than whatever abandoned place you are about to be brought to, that\u2019s why they want you to leave it. Throw a loud fit and run towards people as if your life depended on it (it might). Even if you are injured, you are in a populated place and will receive medical attention. Many people have been murdered and/or sexually assaulted by simply following instructions.\r\n\r\nLove is a risk, but worth it. After exiting a marriage with someone who was such a compulsive liar that he was effectively a stranger, I thought I\u2019d never take that risk again. However, after time (and therapy), I am lucky enough to find myself less than a month away from marrying the best partner I could possibly imagine.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a country that celebrates Halloween, let your children celebrate it as you did when you were young: scared and in the dark. \u201cSafe\u201d events aren\u2019t the point of Halloween, and it isn\u2019t fun for kids.\r\n\r\nWith much luck, health, and happiness,\r\n\r\n\r\nMeghan Callahan\r\nmabnon@gmail.com\r\nDuluth, Minnesota, USA\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 29]]
