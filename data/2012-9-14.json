["[The Listserve] The Grand Experiment", "Zach Napolitano", "I\u2019d like to use this grandest of forums to attempt this grandest of experiments: to launch the new company I\u2019ve been incubating for the past several weeks.\r\n\r\nPresenting... The Listserve Launch:\r\n\r\nWithout patronizing the Listserve user and explaining the crucial role social media plays in a company\u2019s survival, I will just mention that there are thousands of businesses shelling out exorbitant fees for the right to have a behemoth of a consulting firm manage their Twitter and Facebook communities.\r\n\r\nBottom line: I\u2019ve created a lean company, built around a small team of savants whose greatest acumen rests in nurturing vibrant online communities. We\u2019ve worked for national brands and hot VC-backed startups. And since our overhead is basically nonexistent, our full-service social media platform is available for a pittance of what one of the bloated agencies would charge.\r\n\r\nIf you know someone who could use our services, help us at Silicon Alley Social gain a little positive momentum and pass our name along. We\u2019ll be sure to reward anyone who helps us propel this social media pirate ship.\r\n\r\nThanks for being a part of our Listserve Launch!\r\n\r\n\r\nZach Napolitano\r\nzach@siliconalleysocial.com\r\nNYC\r\n\r\n", [2012, 9, 14]]
