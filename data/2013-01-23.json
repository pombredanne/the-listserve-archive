["[The Listserve] Focus", "Jimmy Gambier", "Simple rules to live by:\r\n1. Tell the Truth  \r\n2. Be optimistic - You'll live longer, be happier and potentially make more. If you're not optimistic fake it 'till you are.\r\n3. (Generally) Don't make assumptions \r\n\r\nFor 2 years now I've been a single parent. Nothing has shaped me more than learning to parent alone. The first year was grueling as learning to be mr. mom was never part of my life plan. I kept at it and in time, found peace and a deeper connection with my daughter as a result of the work I put in. \r\n\r\nSimple parenting rules that have helped me:\r\n1. Play is a powerful tool. Learn to play with your kids and use it to teach them lessons.\r\n2. Kids f'in love choices. Give them an option a or option b vs. do a now!\r\n\r\nI live in Seattle and am always looking for interesting people to meet. Drop me a line if you're around. \r\nAlso, my best and I are planning a trip to Barcelona this summer. If any LIstservers are out there, please reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nJimmy Gambier\t\r\njimmygambier@gmail.com\t\r\nSeattle \r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 23]]
