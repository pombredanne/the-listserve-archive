        "I was raised in a very Catholic household, but lately a bit of my once-strong Catholic identity has been peeling away. I haven't been to church since May, I'm questioning my thoughts on a lot of the Church's social doctrines, and I don't pray nearly as often as I used to.\r\n\r\nI got some bad news from home recently about a friend, and only several days later did I even think to pray. Realizing that I had forgotten that astounded me, because in other times that would have been my first instinct. Trying to pray, however, felt no better. I felt weird asking for God's help--like a friend who hasn't called you back in months but suddenly needs a place to crash. I ended up calling my mom and asking her to pray, because I feel like my prayers have by now lost whatever potency they may have ever held.\r\n\r\nIf I'm going to be a lapsed Catholic, I want it to be a product of reading and honest questioning, investigating the philosophical arguments for Catholicism, really narrowing down what I agree with. Basically, I want to have done the legwork\u2014not just have gotten lazy, which is pretty much what happened with going to church. Religion's a tricky thing. I know a lot of people struggle with this, and I'd love to hear about experiences from all sides of the argument. If you have any thoughts, stories, book recommendations, or anything else to share, I'd love to hear from you (or if you'd like me to share whatever recommendations I receive!). Thanks so much for reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nKat Lau\r\nkat.a.lau@gmail.com\r\nNew Haven, CT\r\n\r\nP.S. If you're ever folding many sheets of paper (to make programs, for example), fold several at once, then separate them, stack them on top of each other, and press down on all of the folded edges together at once to make the initial crease sharp. Though it saves time, many people avoid trying to fold many sheets at once because the folds on the outer edge are never as crisp as you'd like them. But this technique gives you the best of both worlds: speed and sharpness.\r\n\r\n",

        "You've caught me at an interesting time. I'm about to pack my bags to start a new job in Tokyo. I've never been to Japan before.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the distant past, there was no life on this planet. Now there is not just life but hugely diverse ecosystems and complex human societies. Some scientists believe that what happened in between was a series of highly unlikely coincidences, one of which resulted in the formation of the first cells. But I prefer a hypothesis that everything we see around us is just sort of what happens when the conditions are right. That when there is a source of energy and the right chemical nutrients, the progression from non-life to life, from simple to complex, is a gradual but almost inevitable one. That the deep interrelationship between life and its planetary environment (sometimes called Gaia theory) is as old if not older than life itself; that life did not cause Gaia so much as arise from it.\r\n\r\nIn Tokyo my job will be to work out some of the details of how complex, life-like phenomena can arise from non-living physical systems. The aim is not to create life but to understand something about it by studying things that are similar but simpler. For me, understanding nature on a deep and mathematical level is a way to unlock and appreciate its beauty. I am very lucky to have a job that allows me to follow this passion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNathaniel Virgo\t\r\nnathaniel.virgo+listserve@gmail.com\t\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n",

        "This month marks the seventh anniversary of finding out I had multiple sclerosis.  I was stunned.  Irrationally, I was certain that I had already been through enough hard stuff, so I shouldn't have to deal with any more.  I lost an eye in a childhood accident.  I was widowed at the age of 39 and raised four children by myself.  But I worked my way to a lucrative career and we thrived.  Nothing kept me down.  Now, surely, this was my time of reward for surviving all those struggles.\r\n\r\nWell, as we all know, life does not work like that.  There is no cosmic balance sheet of adversity vs. good fortune.  It was just my time to face another bad thing.  But I didn't want to, damn it!\r\n\r\nThe disease progressed and I started a downward spiral.  My high powered career and life began to crumble.  Loss mounted upon loss.  And I was consumed by bitterness and anger.\r\n\r\nDevastated by my deterioration, I became virtually homebound.  Everything I loved was slipping away.\r\n\r\nFull of resentment, I was tired of picking myself up.  But so many sources were sending me the same message: pray.  And if you can't pray, just say \"Give me strength\" over and over.  To not make the effort seemed like a slap in the face to all the people who love me and give me credit for being braver than I really am.  I knew I had to choose to pick myself up once again.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarie Cooper\r\nnourishblog@optonline.net\t\r\nJersey Shore, United States\r\n\r\n",

Your memory will improve, you will begin to see the future, you will intuitively avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut please, be patient - it could take days, weeks or even months, this is very individual, so don't panic if nothing happens quickly - eventually, it will - or money back :)\r\n\r\nJust be persistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Demenshin\t \r\nal.dem@nk7.net\t\r\nDuesseldorf, Germany\r\n\r\n",

        "Much has been written in the popular and technical press lately about the emerging electric vehicle, both pro and con.  In spite of wishful thinking, don't expect significant penetration any time this decade.  There is probably a role for EVs but it is not the widespread consumer market.  Rather, it is more likely to be various fleet applications such as delivery vehicles or limited urban transit applications.  For all but the most dedicated clean energy afficionados and hobbyists, or those who can afford a third vehicle, how many consumers can afford to pay the prices being charged for a vehicle with such limited capability?  Most cannot.  Second, there is still the issue that, in most places, the electricity used to recharge an EV will come predominantly from coal.  So, the environmental benefits, at best, are muted. But, cost and performance aside, there is another difficulty with an electric transportation infrastructure that few seem to speak about.  If you loved Big Oil, you will really love Big Monopoly Electric Utility extending its dominance to the transportation sector.  Gasoline prices have at least been shown to be sufficiently elastic that they respond to consumer demand.  And, within a limited range, consumers still have a choice of providers.  Hence, there is at least some semblance of a free market at play -- even if it is an oligopoly.  In contrast, a consumer's only choice for recharging that overpriced EV is the local monopoly utility and to pay whatever its regulator-approved rate is.  Good luck there.  So, there is a use for electro-motive transportation.  It just isn't the one everyone is talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Mignogna, Ph.D., P.E.\r\nGolden, Colorado\r\n@RichMignogna\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Say Yes to Music", 
        "Carlton Lion", 
        "Thought I would share with you the year I said Yes to every music concert I came across. Needless to say it was a very expensive year but also incredibly rewarding and the spirit of musical adventure has stayed with me.\r\n\r\nIt started with a simple wish for this little IT Geek to get out more. I have a love of music \u2013 not just one style but the very thought of music fills me with joy. To that end I decided to go to every concert that I came across or heard about.\r\n\r\nI went to music festivals, choral works, musical theatre and opera; to see blues and rock bands at pubs, country and western stampedes, jazz in the park, saw Leonard Cohen under the stars and cried as I heard Barber\u2019s Adagio for Strings played live for the first time.\r\n\r\nWhat did I learn? I learned to listen. Not just to music but to atmosphere, to the joy of those around me, to wonder at the incredible gestalt that can form between artist(s) and the audience and to rejoice in the ability to allow sound to fill your heart until you are sure you must glow with radiance.\r\n\r\nTo this day I still say Yes to music with three more events added over the weekend.\r\n\r\nI hope that this email may inspire you to say Yes to a new experience in your life. The cuisine of the world is my next adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmiles and thanks for reading.\r\nCarltonLion\r\nCarltonLion@yahoo.com\r\nAustralia\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] A Story of Understanding", 
        "Julia", 
        "When I was 18, my mother discovered that my stepfather had installed a small pinhole camera in my bathroom.\r\n\r\nHe was given several misdemeanors but I did *not* press charges despite the overwhelming pressure from everyone to do so. Actually, seven years later, I'm still in contact with him.\r\n\r\nVery few people understand this decision. They think I should have sued him for all he's worth and destroyed his life. \"Why do you still talk to that pervert?\" they ask.\r\n\r\nMy answer is this: Because I understand what hate will do if I grab hold of it. It will lodge itself in every corner of my mind and soul and I will go through life believing I'm a victim and that things are happening TO me. I'll focus on what I don't have instead of what I do.\r\n\r\nI must instead focus on the good and the love. My stepfather wasn't abusive, verbally or physically, in any way and, in fact, he was a damn good stepfather most of the time.\r\n\r\nWe are who we are not based solely on who we decide to be in any given moment but what society, people around us, and our environment TEACH us to be. Don't jump to conclusions about others. Rather, take the time and energy to understand why they do what they do and how they got to be who they are.\r\n\r\nLook inward. Forgive yourself, forgive others, and put love out into the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove to you all, \r\nJulia \r\njulials219@gmail.com\r\nSeattle, WA\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] \tThe Cooper Union", 
        "Ben Davis", 
        "\"My story today is not my own: it is Peter Cooper\u2019s.  He died in 1883, but his legacy is just as important now as it was then.  He believed that education is a public good - that it should be available to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay, gender, race, religion, social class, or political beliefs.  This may not seem like a huge thing now, but it was then.\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring it up now is because the institution he founded, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, is in trouble.  It has been a full-scholarship college for art, architecture, and engineering students since 1902 but it will run out of money in 2015 unless it gets significant help.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not soliciting donations (I doubt there are a lot of rogue billionaires on this list anyway. . .) but I would like you to take 10 seconds to Google \u201cCooper Union\u201d and learn about Peter Cooper\u2019s dream for education.  It has become my dream as well (I\u2019ve taught there since 2009) and it makes me sad that its future is in jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Davis\r\nbdavis@cooper.edu\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "Yesterday, I was exhausted.\r\n\r\nI'm on year six of raising my children alone. Eight are still at home. For years I languished. Stuck. Broken. But my kids kept growing. All these dreams I've had for us, for me, didn't end because my marriage ended, or I couldn't finance them or find time to breathe life into them. They ended because I gave up on them; resigned myself to the fact that life was always going to be hard. So, I put my dreams on paper and figured out what I needed to do to make them happen. I wrote down what it would feel like to accomplish them. I'm not talking about buying stuff or jetting around the world. I'm talking about living!\r\n\r\nAnd yesterday, exhausted, I almost gave in and slept. Then I saw this pinned to the board above my desk: \u201cDon't give up what you LOVE most for what you WANT now.\u201d My bucket list contains one item: I want to live someplace beautiful. Everything else will fall into place from there. Taking a nap in the miserable heat won't get me there. But knocking out that research paper; boxing up clutter to sell/give away; and snuggling with my kids, talking about our first winter in the snow gets me closer. Going to bed early last night with the kids helped, too.\r\n\r\n'Love dares you to change the way you care about yourself.'\r\n\r\n\u201cUnder Pressure\u201d Queen\r\n\r\n\r\nJennifer Cox\r\ndiscoveringpeace@gmail.com\r\nFt.

        "[The Listserve] Wise words, set to music", 
        "Jeff Robson", 
        "Whenever it comes to finding the right words for a situation (such as now), I often find myself unable to say something clear enough, powerful enough, or smart enough. Luckily, I can always find a songwriter who can do it for me. When I need words of hope or wisdom, or when I need to feel like someone else has felt the same pain and frustration as me, I look for it in song. It seems that here\u2019s always someone who can speak my heart and mind better than I can. Sometimes I need a bit of energy, motivation, a good laugh, or just some entertainment. I find it all in music.\r\n\r\nLook up these writers; I know they\u2019ll give you something that speaks to you. You know how & where to find them. Their songs have done so much for me; the least I can do for them (and for you) is to hope that someone will discover them and enjoy their work, as I have. In no particular order:\r\n\r\nDel Barber\r\nChristina Martin\r\nLeeroy Stagger\r\nJohn K Samson/The Weakerthans\r\nJim Bryson\r\nWillie P Bennett\r\nTownes Van Zandt\r\nPaul Kelly\r\nDavid Francey\r\nMatthew Ryan\r\nRon Hawkins/The Lowest of the Low\r\nThe Warped 45s\r\nThe Blue Shadows\r\nLynn Miles\r\nNQ Arbuckle\r\nShannon Lyon\r\nRose Cousins\r\nOh Susanna\r\nThe Damnwells\r\n\r\nThese are just a few. Without these writers, I might not be alive today. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to get by as well as I do. Let them move you.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeff Robson\r\ntellthebandtogohome@gmail.com\r\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] it's not the destination but the journey", 
        "Jackie Lightfield", 
        "A long time ago in a public school system far away, I learned stuff that would never appear on a standardized test, wrote reams of essays covered with red ink and wondered what the future held. It was the dawn of the digital age, and while I could clearly see how computers would change everything, everything about education did not. Yet the most valuable thing I learned was how to learn and how to fail. The easiest path to failure is to take risks. Everyday I try to do different things, to take a different path, to read something on a topic I've never explored. Today I am a serial entrepreneur. I'm on my seventh start up, an idea I conceived almost six years ago, and one that is all about exploring a journey instead of settling for a destination. Whatever stage of life you find yourself in, take an hour today and do something new. Whether its reading a random book, or walking around a new neighbourhood.  Then keep on doing that every day. Before long you will be your learning journey. Who knows what you'll discover.

        "[The Listserve] What you\u2019ve always heard, and why it isn\u2019t true", 
        "Jared", 
        "Politicians, pundits, and religious figures say the Bible dictates how you should vote on certain issues. Unfortunately, much of it is not true.\r\n\r\nAbortion: It\u2019s not murder, and the penalty for causing a miscarriage against the will of the mother can be a simple fine (Exodus 21). Sometimes God calls for pregnant women (and the fetus) to be put to death (Genesis 38).\r\n\r\nContraception and masturbation: The Bible is silent on these issues. God killed Onan for coitus interruptus (\u201cspilling his seed\u201d), as punishment for refusing to impregnate his brother\u2019s widow (Genesis 38).\r\n\r\nHomosexuality: The Bible says all sex outside of a marriage is wrong and does not differentiate for homosexual acts. But in the same places it also prohibits eating shellfish, tattoos, divorce, wearing gold, wearing clothes made of two different cloths, and other rules absurd to modern society that the church ignores (e.g. Leviticus 11). Why aren\u2019t they protesting retailers and seafood restaurants?\r\n\r\nMarriage: While you may hear that the Bible defines marriage as \u201cone man, one woman\u201d (it doesn\u2019t), it actually has examples of \u201cone man, many women\u201d, \u201ca rapist and his victim\u201d, \u201ca soldier and prisoner of war\u201d.\r\n\r\nWealth: Jesus says it\u2019s hard for the rich to get into heaven, and people should give away all of their possessions. Not tax cuts for the rich.\r\n\r\nBible\u2019s literal truth: Our modern Bible has thousands of changes from the original texts (read any Bart Ehrman book).\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let people cynically manipulate you for their personal gain or prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nJared\t\r\ngoogoljared@gmail.com\t\r\nAtlanta, GA (USA)\r\n\r\n",
