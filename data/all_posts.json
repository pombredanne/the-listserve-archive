        "I'm sorry to break this to you, in an e-mail from a random stranger like this, but it needs to be said: Most of your life won't be fantastic. I'm not joking. The adventures you'll tell your children about will be a minuscule part of it. So if you want to avoid the feeling of utter disappointment as you grow older, you need to accept that fact. Sorry.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the insight: You should focus more on the non-fantastic parts. The parts where you eat breakfast, walk to the bus, have a boring day at work, eat your ordinary lunch, shop groceries, and brush your teeth. After all, this is the major part of your life, and neglecting it is a wasted opportunity.\r\n\r\nHere's the thing: Most of the boring stuff in your life is so dull, that even the tiniest thing can make it seem fun. The tiniest thing. This means the you could make it better with extremely simple means.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly am I talking about here? Little things. Like these:\r\n\r\n* Challenges: When brushing your teeth tonight, use your left hand.\r\n* Mind games: When you enter work (or school!), imagine the sound \"Kabaaaam!\" as you enter, as if your presence changed the whole room.\r\n* Action: Jump down from the side-walk, instead of just stepping down.\r\n* Changes: Buy some fancy tomato sauce tonight, instead of your usual brand.\r\n* More action: Count the number of pink things on your way to work, as if your life depended on it.\r\n\r\nSee? Easy stuff. I really try to live by this \"Everyday Action\" idea, and I think it works for making the boring parts of life more fun. Because that's the thing: just because the fantastic moments are few, there's no reason to just sit there, waiting for the next big thing to swipe you off your feet. Have some fun meanwhile, it's easy...\r\n\r\n/Emil\r\n\r\nEmil Stenstr\u00f6m\r\nem@kth.se\r\nStockholm, Sweden\r\n\r\n",

        "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She was sick of it all.\u00a0 Sick of the contradictions, sick of the distance, and most of all, sick of the silence that ricocheted back and forth across her ear drums, more deafening than a collapsing building.\u00a0 Polite conversation, with its one-worded banter laced in falsity, could be tolerated.\u00a0 But the silence between them was painful.\u00a0 She wondered what had happened to their relationship.\u00a0 At one point they had been much more than just roommates; they had been best friends.\u00a0 They knew things about each other that no one else knew, and they shared secrets that ranged from romance to regrets, from insecurities to ideologies.\u00a0 Their close friendship had helped make the transition from small towns to college life easier for the both of them.\u00a0 Although they had differing personalities, they seemed to complement each other.\u00a0 But, most importantly, they had trusted each other.\u00a0 Recently, all of that had disappeared without warning.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it was time to leave, she didn\u2019t say that she was heading to class.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t want to interrupt the silence, an invisible yet unforgivable barrier that had formed between them.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t owe an explanation for her departure, and she knew she wouldn\u2019t have received a response anyway.\u00a0 Besides, she was sick of trying.\u00a0 She forced her work into a tattered backpack, stuffing notebooks filled with messy, looping handwriting and elaborate margin doodles in between a handful of novels and a laptop.\u00a0 Hoisting the bag over her shoulder, she pulled a battered iPod out of her pocket, inserted the small headphones into her ears, and pressed play.\u00a0 She breathed a sigh of relief.\u00a0 Though it was temporary, her music allowed her to escape from the silence that smothered her.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her class started at 2 o\u2019clock, but her dorm was a good distance away from the English building, so she left at exactly 1:30.\u00a0 She decided to take a bus halfway and then walk the remainder, allowing her to be one of the first to class but still giving her the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful sunny day.\u00a0 The afternoon temperature was unusually warm, and the day seemed to belong in May instead of February.\u00a0 This unexpected heat wave baffled the local weathermen, but it thrilled the students.\u00a0 As she stood at the bus stop, she noticed a few tan, bikini-clad girls were lounging on beach towels outside of her dorm.\u00a0 Several drivers stared at them as they drove by.\u00a0 The bus pulled up next to her, and she felt a familiar rush of warm air graze her cheek.\u00a0 She realized she was sweating.\u00a0 She greeted the bus driver, courteously taking her headphones out of her ears and making eye-contact.\u00a0 An old man with a beard smiled at her, and she smiled back and sat next to him.\u00a0 She fiddled with her iPod, which she had put on Shuffle mode, listening to each song for about five seconds until she changed it, briefly moving from soft jazz to classic rock to hip hop in a rhythmic pace.\u00a0 Her musical taste was eclectic, to say the least, much like her personality.\u00a0 She refused to associate with one particular stereotype.\u00a0 Instead, she dabbled in each one with no notions of stylistic identity, wearing what she liked and listening to what she wanted.\u00a0 Each song, no matter its genre, represented something to her.\u00a0 Sometimes it reminded her of an old friend or a past memory, while other times the bass line just seemed to reflect her mood.\u00a0 She let her emotions choose the song, letting her thumb repeatedly press the \u201cnext\u201d button while she stared out the window.\u00a0 Finally, she settled on a fast-paced, top-40 track that reminded her of high school, a track that she used to listen to with her friends while they drove around town with the stereo turned up and the windows rolled down.\u00a0 It was a track of innocent love, something she had once experienced.\u00a0 She had forgotten how it felt, but after the first few lines she could feel her heart beating along to the familiar melody of the chords.\u00a0 She thought back to that time and briefly admired how much simpler life had been then.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The song abruptly changed to one with repetitious bass pounding and loud, heavy guitar riffs.\u00a0 She quickly forgot of her past, as the nostalgia of blissful immaturity faded away, immediately replaced with the new track\u2019s rapid lyrics. She silently tapped her foot to the pulsating beat.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver lurched to a stop just as a guitar screeched in her ears, and she held on to the pole next to her to prevent herself from being thrown forward.\u00a0 She grabbed her bag, squeezed out from the area that encased her tiny seat, and carefully stepped off the bus onto the pavement and headed toward class.\u00a0 She walked slowly, admiring the way the bright sun shone through the naked trees, trees that weren\u2019t ready to bloom and probably wouldn\u2019t be ready for a few months, if that.\u00a0 The winter had been abnormally harsh that year, and it was predicted that the trees would probably bloom later than normal as a result.\u00a0 The vivid, recent image of the trees covered in snow sprang into her mind, and she realized a week ago, she had to wear a winter coat and gloves while walking to class.\u00a0 Now, it was forty degrees warmer and anyone wearing a coat would be scalding.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She briefly glanced at the people she passed by.\u00a0 Class had just gotten out, so the pathways were crowded.\u00a0 Several groups of rowdy boys walked past, describing their drunken hook-ups from the previous weekend and rambunctiously slapping each other on the back.\u00a0 They were all dressed similarly, wearing khaki shorts and pastel-colored polo shirts, their dark hair sticking out from underneath backward baseball caps.\u00a0 They were tall and handsome, and they all seemed to have similar features.\u00a0 Their collective good-looks repulsed her.\u00a0 There was no variety; they were all the same.\u00a0 Next to them walked large packs of girls, most of them blond and tan with thin, dainty physiques.\u00a0 Some of them wore brightly colored sundresses.\u00a0 Others wore tennis shoes and running shorts, though their neatly combed back hair and flawlessly applied make-up gave no indication of exercise.\u00a0 They were all beautiful, but they blended together, no one face standing out amongst the others.\u00a0 In the beginning of the school year, she had envied their apparent mass perfection.\u00a0 She began dressing up to go to class and started wearing makeup.\u00a0 Though she rarely wore earrings, she began to stick pearls into her ears every day, regardless of her outfit.\u00a0 She even abandoned her tomboyish wardrobe and occasionally wore dresses or skirts.\u00a0 But, soon enough, she got sick of it.\u00a0 She grew sick of waking up early every morning to straighten her hair, to put together a perfectly matching outfit.\u00a0 She grew sick of pretending to be someone she was not just to fit into a crowd of people that she did not resemble in the slightest.\u00a0 Instead, she forced herself apart from her classmates.\u00a0 She gradually got used to the fraternity boys looking right through her, as if she didn\u2019t exist, and to the girls in class talking to each other but not to her.\u00a0 She watched them converse as they walked past, but her music pounded in her ears, preventing her from hearing them.\u00a0 As she walked, she noticed that she was the only one wearing jeans.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked down at her iPod as she approached the building, checking the time.\u00a0 About ten minutes early.\u00a0 Not too bad.\u00a0 She systematically entered the building, walked down three flights of stairs, took a left, then a right, then a left again.\u00a0 Before entering, she turned off her music, wrapped up the headphones carefully, and put the iPod into her pocket.\u00a0 Then she entered, just like always.\u00a0 The only difference was that, this time, she was standing in a room of emptiness.\u00a0 The light was off, and the lack of windows made her feel as if she were standing in a cave instead of a classroom.\u00a0 It was completely silent, apart from the humming of a computer that sat in the corner, its screensaver a series of random twists and turns that filled the screen with color.\u00a0 This computer was the only source of light, and the screensaver\u2019s colors faintly shined across the room onto the wall.\u00a0 A technological rainbow.\u00a0 She was mildly surprised at the unexpected abyss she was standing in.\u00a0 Even though she was ten minutes early, she was never the first one to class.\u00a0 She felt as if she were trespassing, even though she was in the right place.\u00a0 She watched as the computer went into sleep mode, the screen blackening like the room around her.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She considered waiting outside in the hallway for someone else to arrive, but she decided to turn on the light switch next to the door instead.\u00a0 She went and sat down in her usual seat.\u00a0 The song she had just been listening to was repeating itself inside of her head; she quietly hummed and tapped her foot to the rhythm.\u00a0 Out of boredom, she pulled out one of her worn notebooks, its pages nearly filled up even though the semester had only started a month or two ago, and finished a doodle she had drawn of a man that had popped into her head but probably didn\u2019t actually exist.\u00a0 She shaded his cheekbones with a stubby pencil, drew then erased then redrew his thick eyebrows, and lightly added eyelashes to his bright, wide eyes that seemed to be staring directly at her.\u00a0 His lips were turned slightly upward in a mischievous half grin, as if he knew something about her that no one else did.\u00a0 Once she was satisfied with her finished sketch, she awoke from her artistic trance and realized that she was still alone.\u00a0 She turned on her iPod and glanced at the clock.\u00a0 3:02.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confused and suddenly worried that she was in the wrong room, she opened the door and looked at the room number.\u00a0 It was then that she noticed the blue post-it on the door.\u00a0 \u201cNo class today.\u00a0 Office hours will be held as usual tomorrow.\u00a0 Sorry for any inconvenience.\u201d\u00a0 While most students would probably celebrate this cancelation, she felt empty, as empty as the room she was standing in.\u00a0 Instead of the interaction she longed for, even if it was forced, she was once again thrust into an abnormal solitude.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She walked down the hallway and joined the throng of people walking home.\u00a0 Although she was submersed by the crowd, she still seemed to be set apart from them somehow.\u00a0 She turned on her iPod and inserted her headphones to escape from the nothingness that surrounded her.\u00a0 Here, she was the queen of her own world, a world with only one citizen.\u00a0 Her world made sense; it was one of sound and song.\u00a0 The bass drum of her heartbeat set the 4/4 rhythm and her footsteps pounded along in harmonized reverberation.\u00a0 This beat was steady and calming, unlike the confusion that she felt as she glanced at the people that passed her by. She watched the crowd around her as their lips moved, almost synchronized, but no sound came out.\u00a0 Concentrating intently on the rhythm that surrounded her, she looked ahead at the trees in the distance.\u00a0 The sun brightened their bare, crooked limbs, and though it was still early in the year, she saw what looked to be a single white blossom slowly emerging to greet the unfamiliar sun.\u00a0 Her smile bloomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily\r\nVirginia\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Volatile Software", 
        "Steve Losh", 
        "I want to use my fifteen minutes of fame on The Listserve to rant about\r\nsomething that's close to my heart: the stability of the software I use.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is written for people who create software.  If you don't do that you\r\nprobably won't find this very interesting.  Sorry!  Maybe you could read Text\r\nfrom Dog if you haven't seen it already?  Either way, have a nice\r\nmorning/afternoon/evening!\r\n\r\nThe Situation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nEvery time I get a new computer, I go through the same song and dance:\r\n\r\n1. Look at what programs and packages I have installed on the old computer.\r\n2. Install these programs on the new computer.\r\n3. Copy over my configuration files from the old computer to the new one.\r\n4. Spend the rest of my day fixing all the things that broke because I'm using\r\n    a newer version of program X.\r\n\r\nStep 4 is always the most painful part of getting a new machine.  Always.\r\n\r\nWithout fail I spend several hours tweaking configuration files, adjusting my\r\nworkflow, and so on because I've upgraded to a new version of foo which doesn't\r\nsupport option X any more or requires library Y version N+1 now.\r\n\r\nGetting a new computer should be a *pleasant* experience!  The unboxing from the\r\nsleek packaging, that \"new laptop\" smell, the nostalgia of the default desktop\r\nimage.  Why does this horrible step 4 have to exist and how can we get rid of\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThe Divide\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI've noticed something interesting lately: I can categorize almost *all* of the\r\nsoftware I use into two distinct groups:\r\n\r\n* Software that breaks pretty much *every* time I update it (e.g. weechat,\r\n  offlineimap, Clojure, many Python packages, Skype).\r\n* Software that almost *never* breaks when I update it (e.g. Mercurial, git,\r\n  tmux, Python, ack, zsh, Vim, Dropbox).\r\n\r\nSoftware that falls in between these two extremes is surprisingly rare.  There\r\nseems to be a pretty clean divide between the two groups.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that there's some special attribute or quality of the\r\nsecond group (or its authors) which the first one lacks.\r\n\r\nBrokenness\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI think it's important that I nail down what I mean by \"breaks\" or \"is broken\".\r\nI don't necessarily just mean the introduction of \"new bugs\".\r\n\r\nWhen I say that a program \"breaks\", I mean:\r\n\r\n* When I update from version X to version Y of a program, library, or language...\r\n* Without changing my configuration files, source code, etc...\r\n* The resulting combination doesn't work properly\r\n\r\nIn effect, I'm saying that \"breaking backwards compatibility\" means \"the program\r\nis broken\"!\r\n\r\nThis may be a strong statement, but I stand by it in most cases.\r\n\r\nBackwards compatibility matters!  Every time someone makes a backwards\r\nincompatible change in a program or library, they cost the world the following\r\namount of time:\r\n\r\n    Number of people          Time it takes each person\r\n    using that part of      X    to figure out what changed\r\n    the program                   and how to fix it\r\n \r\nOften this can be a significant amount of time!\r\n\r\nThe Process of Updating\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nWhen pointing out a backwards incompatible change to someone, you'll often get\r\na response similar to this:\r\n\r\n    \"Well, I mentioned that backwards incompatibility in the changelog, so what\r\n    the hell, man!\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm updating a piece of software there's a good chance it's not because I'm\r\nspecifically updating *that program*.  I might be:\r\n\r\n* Moving to a new computer.\r\n* Running a \"$PACKAGE_MANAGER update\" command.\r\n* Moving a website to a bigger VPS and reinstalling all the libraries.\r\n\r\nIn those cases (and many others) I'm not reading the release notes for\r\na specific program or library.  I'm not going to find out about the brokenness\r\nuntil I try to use the program the next time.\r\n\r\nIf I'm lucky the program will have a \"this feature is now deprecated, read the\r\ndocs\" error message.  That's still a pain, but at least it's less confusing than\r\njust getting a traceback, or worst of all: silently changing the behavior of\r\na feature.\r\n\r\nProgress\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI completely understand that when moving *backwards* to an older version\r\nI should expect problems.  The older version hasn't had the benefit of the extra\r\nwork done on the new version, so of course it should be less stable.\r\n\r\nBut when I'm *updating* to a higher version number the software should be\r\n*better* and *more stable*!  It has had more work done on it, and I assume no\r\none is actively trying to make software worse, so why does something that\r\npreviously worked no longer work?\r\n\r\nWe're supposed to be making *progress* as we move forward.  The software has had\r\n*more* work done on it, why does it not function correctly *now* when it\r\nfunctioned correctly *before*?\r\n\r\nYes, this means developers will need to add extra code to handle old\r\ninput/configuration.  Yes, this is a pain in the ass, but *the entire point of\r\nmost software is to save people time by automating things*.  Again, every\r\nbackwards-incompatible change costs the world an amount of time:\r\n\r\n    Number of people         Time it takes each person\r\n    using that part of     X      to figure out what changed\r\n    the program                  and how to fix it\r\n\r\nIf our goal is to *save time* then we should not make changes that *cost time*.\r\nOr at least we should not make such changes lightly.\r\n\r\nA Culture of Sadness\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nProof that this is a real issue can be found in the tools we use every day.  As\r\nprogrammers we've invented elaborate dependency systems to deal with it.\r\n\r\nWe say \"pip install django==1.3\" or put \"[clojure \"1.2\"]\" in our Leiningen\r\nproject.clj files to avoid using the newest versions because they'll break.\r\n\r\nStep back and look at this for a second.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell?\r\n\r\nWhat the *hell*?\r\n\r\nWe have invented software with features designed to help us use *old* versions\r\nof other software!\r\n\r\nWe have *written code* to *avoid* using the \"latest and greatest\" software!\r\n\r\nObviously this is not entirely bad, but the fact that manually specifying\r\nversion numbers to avoid running *newer* code is commonplace, expected, and\r\na \"best practice\" horrifies me.\r\n\r\nI would *love* to be able to say something like this in my requirements.txt and\r\nproject.clj files:\r\n\r\n    Of *course* I want the latest version of library X!  I want *all* the\r\n    newest bug fixes and improvements!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't do that right now because so many projects make backwards\r\nincompatible changes all the time.\r\n\r\nThe moment I try to build the project at some point in the future I'll be sent\r\non a wild goose chase to figure out what function moved into what other\r\nnamespace and what other function was split into its own library and dammit the\r\ndocumentation on the project's website is autogenerated from the tip of its git\r\nrepo and so it doesn't apply to the latest actual version and jesus christ\r\nI think I'll just quit programming and teach dance full time instead even though\r\nI'll go hungry.\r\n\r\nThe Tradeoff\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOne could argue that sometimes backwards incompatible changes cost time up front\r\nbut save time in the long run by making the software more \"elegant\" and \"lean\".\r\n\r\nWhile I'm sure there are cases where this is true, I feel like it's a cop out\r\nmost of the time.  Allow me to illustrate this with a helpful Venn diagram:\r\n\r\n                                    -------\r\n                                   /3333333\\\r\n                                  |333333333|\r\n                                   \\3333333/\r\n                                    -------\r\n\r\n    11 -> People who give a shit what a program's codebase\r\n    11    looks like.\r\n\r\n    22 -> The authors of said program.\r\n    22\r\n\r\nFor libraries where the author is the only user, none of this rant applies.\r\nYou're free!  Break as much as you like!\r\n\r\nFor the majority of libraries, however, there are probably vastly more \"users\"\r\nthan \"authors\".  Saving a few hours of the authors' own time has to be weighed\r\nagainst the 10 minutes each that the hundreds of users will have to spend\r\nfiguring out what happened and working around it.\r\n\r\nI want to be clear: being backwards compatible *doesn't* mean sacrificing new\r\nfeatures!  New features can still be added!  Refactoring can still happen!\r\n\r\nIn most cases keeping backwards compatibility simply means maintaining a bit of\r\nwrapper code to support people using the previous version.\r\n\r\nFor example: in Python, if we moved the public foo() function to a new module,\r\nwe'd put the following line in the original module:\r\n\r\n    from newmodule import new_foo as foo\r\n\r\nIs it pretty?  Hell no!  But this single line of code will probably save more\r\npeople more time than most of the other lines in the project!\r\n\r\nThis may just be an artifact of how my brain is wired, but I actually get\r\na sense of satisfaction from writing code that bridges the gap between older\r\nversions and new.\r\n\r\nI can almost hear a little voice in my head saying:\r\n\r\n    \"Mwahaha, I'll slip this refactoring past them and they'll never even know\r\n    it happened!\"\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just me, but I think that \"glue\" code can be clever and beautiful in\r\nits own right.\r\n\r\nIt may not bring a smile to anyone's face like a shiny new feature, but it\r\nprevents many frowns instead, and preventing a frown makes the world a happier\r\nplace just as much as creating a smile!\r\n\r\nExceptions\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOne case where I feel the backwards incompatibility tradeoff *is* worth it is\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nA good example of this is Django's change which made AJAX requests no longer be\r\nexempt from CSRF checks.  It was backwards incompatible and I'm sure it broke\r\nsome people's projects, but I think it was the right thing to do because it\r\nimproved security.\r\n\r\nI also think it's unreasonable to expect all software to be perfectly ready from\r\nits first day.\r\n\r\nSometimes software needs to get poked and prodded in the real world before it's\r\nfully baked, and until then requiring strict backwards compatibility will do\r\nmore harm than good.\r\n\r\nBy all means, backwards compatibility should be thrown to the wind in the first\r\nstage of a project's life.  At the beginning it needs to find its legs, like\r\na baby gazelle on the Serengeti.  But at some point the project needs to get its\r\nbalance, grow up, and start concerning itself with backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nBut when should that happen?\r\n\r\nA Solution\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI think there's a simple, intuitive way to mark the transition of a piece of\r\nsoftware from \"volatile\" to \"stable\":\r\n\r\n    Version 1.0\r\n\r\nBefore version 1, software can change and evolve rapidly with no regards for\r\nbreaking, but once that first number becomes \"greater than or equal to 1\" it's\r\ntime to be a responsible member of the software community and start thinking\r\nabout the real humans whose time gets wasted for every breaking change.\r\n\r\nThis is the approach semantic versioning takes, and I think it's the right one.\r\n\r\nI know a lot of people dislike semantic versioning.  They hate how requires\r\nincrementing the major version number every time a breaking change is made.\r\n\r\nI consider it to be a *good* thing.\r\n\r\nYou *should* pause and carefully consider making a change that will break\r\npeople's current code.\r\n\r\nYou *should* be ashamed if your project is at version 43.0.0 because you've made\r\n42 breaking changes.  That's 43 times you've disregarded your users' time!\r\nThat's a bad thing!\r\n\r\nAs programmers we need to start caring about the people we write software for.\r\n\r\nBefore making a change that's going to cause other people pain, we should ask\r\nourselves if it's really worth the cost.  Sometimes it is, but many times it's\r\nnot, and we can wrap the change up so it doesn't hurt anyone.\r\n\r\nSo please, before you make that backwards incompatible change, think of the\r\nother human beings who are going to smack their monitors when your software\r\nbreaks.\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n-------------",

        "[The Listserve] Five Tips to Starting a New Business", 
        "Joshua Siler", 
        "I've been in business for a long time now, and every once in awhile, I'll get friends and family asking me to talk through their business plans with them. It's one of my favorite things to do! Along the way, I've come up with a few things that seem to apply to every type of business.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking about starting a business, or in the beginning stages, here are a few tips to help you start your venture.\r\n\r\n1) Decide what your goals are, and how hard you want to work. There's a big difference between a plan that ends with you making a comfortable living vs. one with a $100M payout. Decide what route is right for you. \r\n\r\n2) Do something you're truly passionate about. If it doesn't sound like an exciting adventure, to you, from the beginning, keep looking for the right opportunity. Starting a new business can be a rough road, and requires a certain level of belief and momentum to keep going. If you're not into it, it's hard to keep it going during the hard times.\r\n\r\n3) Build a 3-year plan. Sit down with a financial spreadsheet and build a model for your business that takes into account expenses and revenue as you grow for 3 years. If you haven't done this before, get a help! This will tell you whether your idea is a viable business or not. \r\n\r\n4) Have customers lined up before you begin. If you can't convince at least a handful of people to agree to try out and ultimately pay for your product and service once it's ready, then you should really think about whether it will work. Too many companies have failed because the founders put their sweat, blood and tears into something no one wanted. \r\n\r\n5) Start. A major key to success with a new business is prioritizing. If you're doing it right, there will always be more to do then you can accomplish. The hardest part is deciding what NOT to do while making steady progress.\r\n\r\nHope that helps someone get started! \r\n\r\nFor those that are interested, I recently started a new company called HiringThing. It's easy-to-use online software that helps companies post jobs online, organize applicants and hire great employees. Check us out online, or feel free to get in touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoshua Siler\r\njoshuas@hiringthing.com\r\nPortland, OR\r\n\r\n",

        "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI want to write about a subject that is very close to my heart - bees! I started bee keeping last year, and have two colonies right now. These two already managed to supply my family and my friends with more than enough honey, and keeping the bees is a tremendously satisfying activity. They smell so good, and are very tidy animals, and are just very, very interesting overall. The insects' way of dealing with the world is just so very different from how we as mammals approach it - it seems almost alien.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what is probably most impressive is the workload these little animals deal with. For one kilo of honey, they visit 4 million flowers, and fly a distance equivalent of more than 4 times around the earth. Think about that for a second.\r\n\r\nAnd then, if you start to think about how they \"furniture\" their housing themselves by the wax they sweat out, how they can control temperature inside the hive to the tenth of a degree, how they collectively make decisions in a group of 50'000 (the queen has nothing to say in that sense, she is only the breeding unit)\u2026 the amazement never stops.\r\n\r\nAnyhows, next time you complain about how tough your life is - have a spoon of honey and think of the bees. And start to keep some! (You can also do it in the city - no excuses!)\r\n\r\nThat is all :) Best wishes,\r\n\r\nMoritz from Germany\r\nmoritz@stefaner.eu\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Patrick of Ireland", 
        "Will Fitzgerald", 
        "Once upon a time \u2014 and listen, for although this sounds like a fable, I will try to make every word true \u2014 once upon a time there was a young boy named Patrick, a young Christian boy whose father was a deacon, and whose grandfather was a priest. Patrick, though he was raised in a Christian household did not himself know God. I imagine he was like most people, just living his life out without much concern for spiritual things.\r\n\r\nBut then something really terrible happened. Raiders attacked his parents\u2019 villa, and Patrick was taken off to be a slave in Ireland. I suspect that his parents had plans for him to go off to the city to become an educated gentleman. Instead, he was taken off at age sixteen to become a slave. Instead of going to school, he was forced to become a shepherd.\r\n\r\nIn his loneliness and emptiness, he began to remember what he knew about God. And he started to pray the prayers he had been taught; I don\u2019t know what prayers, but I imagine he prayed the \u201cOur Father.\u201d He started praying more and more \u2014 in the fields at night and during the day, even waking up before daylight to pray, praying up to, he says, 100 prayers in a day. God started to burn in him.\r\n\r\nHe was a slave until he was about twenty, and then something very spooky but real happened. He was sleeping, but he heard a voice saying he was going home soon. Soon after he heard the voice again saying that his boat was ready. He immediately fled from his slave-owner, for he recognized that this was a message directly from God. He had to travel 200 miles to get to the harbor where the ship was, in a land he did not know, among people whom he did not know.\r\n\r\nHe found the ship, and they almost didn\u2019t take him. After the visions and after walking 200 miles, I imagine he was disappointed. He headed back to the hut where he was staying praying along the way. As he was walking and praying, one of the men shouted at him to come back; he could get a ride with them.\r\n\r\nThey traveled for three days before they landed, and then the whole group started walking \u2014 after twenty-eight days, their food ran out, and it was uninhabited. His companions were kind to have taken him in, but now they were hungry and cranky, and began to taunt him about God, asking that perennial question: If God is so great and powerful, why isn\u2019t God helping us?\r\n\r\nPatrick had good reason to trust that God had something other than starving in mind for them, though, and he told them boldly that they should become Christians. He also said that God was going to provide so much food that very day that they couldn\u2019t eat any more. And so it happened: a herd of pigs came by, and I imagine they had a pretty good pork barbecue. Their attitude towards God and Patrick changed that day; in fact, they had fire and food enough for the rest of their journey.\r\n\r\nPatrick eventually was able to return to his kinsfolk, and he was glad to return, and they were glad to have him. But Patrick had another dream: a man named Victorius bringing letters from Ireland, and in his dream he read one of the letters. The letter said it was \u201cThe Voice of the Irish,\u201d and he could hear the voices of people he knew in Ireland begging him to return to return to the land of his slavery.\r\n\r\nSo Patrick returned to Ireland to preach. He didn\u2019t cast out the snakes; we don\u2019t know if he used a shamrock to teach the Trinity; the hymns attributed to him are most likely not by him. But we know he continued to face hardship. In fact, he was kidnapped at least one more time for two months. Patrick\u2019s life was full of ups and downs, He was ashamed of his poor education (poor man, he only knew three or so languages and wrote his confession in Latin that was perhaps not up to par). He called himself a stutterer, though he preached to thousands. He felt that \u201cpoverty and failure suited him better than wealth and delight.\u201d He certainly never got wealthy ministering to the Irish. He remained homesick, I think, to the end of his days. But he recognized the work of God through him, but he felt bound by the Spirit to remain in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Fitzgerald\r\nwill.fitzgerald@gmail.com\r\nKalamazoo, Michigan and San Mateo, California\r\n\r\n",

        "Goodbyes.\r\n\r\nI've had to say goodbye more times than I would have liked.\r\nBut I guess everyone can say that.\r\nI'm not talking about the see you later goodbye or the goodbye we automatically address to a waiter. \r\nI refer to THE goodbye. The one that tears up our throat and make our eyes go all wetty when we say it. \r\nWe all know it. No matter what the circumstance is.\r\n\r\nThis goodbye is usually said to people who really matter to us and it for instance occurs when we are moving far enough from them that they won't be as easily reachable as they were. \r\nWhat makes this moment difficult is that we are aware that not only we're saying goodbye to a person, we're saying goodbye to a relationship. Deep down we know that this bond won't be the same anymore. \r\nIt may progressively vanished as the time goes by or get stronger. It merely depends on individuals.\r\nBut when we say goodbye we don't know how things will be and it's confusing. It feels like a chapter of our life is done and somehow we are scared of the upcoming one. It's the unknown part of our future that spook us.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, no matter how many times we do it, even when it's for the greater good, it still stinks. It really does. And though we will never forget what we've given up, we owe it to ourselves to keep moving forward. \r\nWhat we can't do, is live our lives always afraid of the next goodbye, because chances are, they're not going to stop.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to recognize when a goodbye can be a good thing, when it's a chance to start again, a chance to discover new things, to meet new people. \r\n\r\nHelloes.\r\n\r\nAnd when meeting someone for the first time, the adage wants the conversation to start with \"Hello!\".\r\nWhen we think about it, this word is the nicest thing someone can say to a perfect stranger. \r\nWe could perfectly say what we want to say without saying \"Hello\". We don't need it to make our speech understandable. But still we say it. And for what other reason than expecting a nice and courteous conversation with someone.  \r\n\r\nHint: Add a smile! It's painless and makes everything just brighter.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just think that this little word \"Hello\" can be the first stone set to the foundation of a great relationship. \r\nWe are probably missing great relationship with great people just by not talking to them. Sometimes we just hold back and get shy to talk to someone we think is interesting and worth knowing. \r\nWe should just jump and do what we really want to do. What is it that's holding us back? \r\nIf it's not literally a 200 pounds ball chained to our feet then we have no excuses.\r\n\r\nThere is beauty in the world and guess what humans being are part of this beauty. So say Hello to it as much as you can. \r\nGoodbyes are part of life. If they hurt it just means that the first Hello involved was a blessing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWissam Bounejra\r\nwissam.bounejra@gmail.com\r\nLondon, England\r\n\r\n",

        "Hello!\r\n\r\nThese are some things I've learned which guide the way I think, and which I value most. I hope they are the most valuable things I can offer to you. Of course, they come entirely from others, who I've paraphrased or quoted below. (I'll reference at the bottom.)\r\n\r\nThere is more advice and knowledge than I can ever consume. Most of it is probably good and useful to some extent. Hence, choice and prioritization are even more important.\r\n\r\nThe way something is presented is often more important than its content. The most important part of the way something is presented is how long it takes someone to consume it.\r\n\r\nTime is the most important thing I have: \"it has been said that time is money. That proverb understates the case. Time is a great deal more than money. If you have time you can obtain money--usually. But though you have the wealth of a cloak-room attendant at the Carlton Hotel, you cannot buy yourself a minute more time than I have, or the cat by the fire has\" (Bennett).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll spend maybe a third of my life sleeping. Traditionally, another third working, but: \"there\u2019s a common misconception that work is necessary. You will meet people working at miserable jobs. They tell you they are 'making a living'. No, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re dying, frittering away their fast-extinguishing lives doing things which are, at best, meaningless and, at worst, harmful. People will tell you that work ennobles you, that work lends you a certain dignity. Work makes you free. The slogan \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d was placed at the entrances to a number of Nazi concentration camps. Utter nonsense. Do not waste the vast majority of your life doing something you hate so that you can spend the small remainder sliver of your life in modest comfort. You may never reach that end anyway\" (Tan).\r\n\r\nI try to guide what I do by this simple dictum: to do everything I do with intention. If one is happy to be average, it will happen. Being average is the default. Create, rather than consume. Consume with intention: don't watch TV, watch a show.\r\n\r\nLast, I try to be mindful. What I mean by that is to be active in choosing what I think about, and to fight the defaults. Which is to say, for me, to be ego-centric. I like this mind-game from David Foster Wallace: \"there are totally different ways to think about these [miserable, tedious] kinds of situations... [perhaps] the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way. Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.\" But the point is not so much what you should think, rather that you get to choose what to think, and especially that you can choose to be happy. Strive to be happy.\r\n\r\n-Sam\r\n\r\nArnold Bennett's How to Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day.\r\nAdrian Tan's commencement speech to NTU in 2008, \"Don't work, be hated, love someone.\"\r\nDavid Foster Wallace's commencement Speech to Kenyon College in 2005, \"This is water.\"\r\nMax Ehrmann's Desiderata.\r\n\r\n\r\nSam\r\nProvidence, RI\r\n\r\n",

        "In 2006, I worked as a business journalist and did fun things like flying around the world to interview executives and reporting about what really rich people do with their money.  I had a 9-to-5 job and an awesome salary. Three years later, the financial crisis hit and I, along with thousands of other people, was out of a job.  So, for the first few days of my unemployment, I did what any other right-minded woman would do: I went to all of the sample sales that were happening during the daytime in New York and bought a lot of shoes. Eventually, my dwindling bank account forced me to open up my laptop and scour the Internet for jobs.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no activity more disheartening than searching for jobs. Except watching an episode of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d while you\u2019re out of a job, which I did, and it sucked. I applied for 23 jobs, and after each rejection, I spiraled down a path of self-doubt, uncertainty and depression.  I had no direction in life. I felt like I was underwater, and I didn\u2019t know which way was up.\r\n\r\nIn my misery, I started to try new things. I learned how to cook.  I took up tango dancing.  I read Harry Potter in Spanish.  I bought a harmonica so I could sing away my blues.\r\n\r\nI dared to try all of these things that I never had the courage to do before. But my biggest dare by far was to abandon the job search and apply to art school, to a program called ITP. Never in a million years did I think I would apply to art school.  But the next two years were the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding times of my life.  I learned how to program phone apps, make robots, create art and do things that I never thought I was capable of doing.\r\n\r\nWhen I lost my job, I was poor, eating cliff bars for meals and collecting free samples of eye cream from Sephora. Today, I am still poor, eating cliff bars for meals and collecting free samples of eye cream from Sephora.  What\u2019s different, however, is my preconceived notion of my career path and who I am.  Hitting rock bottom was the catalyst for me to reinvent myself and try things I never thought I could do.  Like, I used to want to be a journalist.  Now, I want to be a NBA basketball player. ;p\r\n\r\nSo, we will all undoubtedly hit many setbacks in our life. But embrace them because it\u2019s a good kick-in-the-pants to try something new. Your \u201cfailures\u201d could turn out to be the best experiences of your life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnh Q. Ly\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n",

        "Hi everyone,\r\nToday I\u2019m taking a mental health day.  At least, that\u2019s what I call them.  Sometimes I need a break.  Especially at this time of the year, because it\u2019s the end of the semester and I have so much to do and I haven\u2019t been eating as healthy as I could or exercising as much as I like or sleeping as much as I need.\r\nI\u2019m an ambitious, busy, independent person.  It\u2019s really hard for me to admit that I need breaks.  But I\u2019m admitting it to all 13,226 of you (yes, I just checked) because I want you to feel okay about it admitting it, too.   Taking the time out to recharge your batteries is often very productive \u2013 it gives you the clear mind and the energy you need to tackle your next great project.\r\nI have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow, and the day afterward.  I have a hundred things I want to do in the near future.  But today, I need a break, and I\u2019m doing the things that make me feel healthy and happy.  Before I go out and conquer the world or something.\r\nBefore I go, a really fantastic high school student asked me to tell you this: \u201cEveryday is a Restart Day.\u201d  Today, I\u2019m restarting \u2013 I\u2019m eating well, exercising, and getting a full night\u2019s rest before I embark on tomorrow\u2019s journey.

        "[The Listserve] Under The Tree Where It's Safe", 
        "maura johnston", 
        "The focal point of my elementary school's lobby was a big painting of two girls sitting under a lushly blossoming tree, looking down at what was either a book or a game or a picnic; my rememberance of those particular details is a bit fuzzy. But I remember the artwork, how its depiction of a pastoral spring day loomed over the hallway of the 1950s-issue school, and I also remember that it was in honor of two girls that had passed away. I'd thought, back when I saw it on a daily basis, that they had been killed in a car accident at some point before I'd reached school age.\r\n\r\nMemory is a funny thing, though. It turned out that the two girls had actually died when I was in kindergarden, on a May day in 1981. This fact came up by accident on Saturday, when I was sitting in my parents' kitchen, the same one where I ate breakfast every day before trucking off to school and seeing that painting. My mother and I were talking about fear and Etan Patz, whose name had recently popped up in the news like a ghost from the beginning of that period in history where children were not just seen as the future but were seen as potential prey for media-created bogeyman with evil intentions -- baby-food poisoners, overly friendly bicycle-repair guys played by Gordon Jump, Satanist preschool teachers. \"That shook me to the core,\" she said. \"And then, those girls on Myers Avenue...\"\r\n\r\nI didn't know what she was talking about, but she filled me in -- don't you remember the painting, she asked me. I did, of course, and it turned out that it was painted in honor of the two girls, who had been brutally murdered, along with their mother, in the spring of 1981. The coroner, my mother noted, had never seen anything so brutal, so many stab wounds, such reckless disregard for another person's\r\nhumanity, let alone three of them. The crime shook our suburb, a grid-planned section of Long Island populated by so many who had left their outerborough upbringings for what they assumed would be a Better\r\nLife, not just because of the trees and bigger houses but because of the illusion of safety, an idea that seemed ever more tenuous with the increasingly bad news emanating from televisions and newspapers but that could at least be achieved on a nuclear-families-in-it-together level. But it was one of those subtle earthquakes that only affects structures, one where the damage isn't fully revealed until many years later. The parents kept a brave face and cloaked the most gruesome details -- or at least, mine did, judging by how shocked I was on Saturday morning, hearing this awful, 31-year-old news as the sunlight beamed into the kitchen where my mother had probably first learned of this tragedy all those years ago.\r\n\r\nThat night I got home and started pulling up accounts of the crime; the first few I found were wire mentions of the perpetrator being caugh. And then this, from the New York Times, May 2, 1981:\r\n\r\n\"It was Donald Williams Jr. who several hours earlier had reported to the police that he had been attacked on Myers Avenue at 4 A.M. as he was returning home from a night out. He described his assailant as a young black man with medium build, who he said had come out of the darkness, stabbed him in both hands and the chest and then quickly fled.\"\r\n\r\nAh, the \"young black man.\" You might not be surprised to find out that it was actually Williams, the family's across-the street neighbor, who committed the crime, a fact that the police figured out quickly (he was indicted less than a week later). That he floated a story that played into the prejuidices of the people who would be investigating and thinking about the crime probably isn't surprising, although it is depressing. But then again, doesn't fear play on those thoughts that lurk in peoples' brains -- especially those that are the ugliest to reveal outside of the context of a narrative that will support them?\r\n\r\nPopular recollections of the 1980s might involve dayglo and stockbrokers, but for me, so much of that decade's narrative is wrapped up in the concept of being afraid. Some of it was personal: I was sickly when I was young; I was nerdy when I was older. But the milk cartons and movies of the week and the examinations of Halloween candy and so many other things created an atmosphere that taught children to look not just before they leapt, but before they even took the most miniscule step toward another person. It's something I'm still trying to shake off today, and when I read so many of the recollections of my peers about topics of all sorts, I wonder how many of them are still, in the depths of their minds, preyed upon by the vague memories of tales about people who are out to do nothing but cause them harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nmaura johnston\r\nmaura@maura.com\r\nAstoria, N.Y.\r\n\r\n",

        "Hey guys!\r\n\r\nToday I want to talk about a place very special to my heart: the country of Albania.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the point you groan with boredom; that's it? That's our email of the day? An informational on some little country?\r\n\r\nAs an Albanian-American who was born there and has returned several times to fall in love with the nation all over again, I am hoping I can dissuade any preconceived notions you might have. Albania is a small Eastern European country in the Balkans that is directly north of Greece. It has a long history of occupations (ex: Italy,  the Ottoman Turks, etc.) and as such has an interesting fusion of a culture that blends old and new.\r\n\r\nBut let's get right into the heart of this. I urge you to GO visit. Take the path less traveled, this is what you'll find:\r\n\r\n-A light-hearted, generous people (the role of the guest is an *extremely* important concept in Albanian culture - you will be in good hands)\r\n-Pristine beaches with clear water on the Adriatic Sea (this will vary by location, but I am strongly encouraging you to go to Vlora for gorgeous beaches)\r\n-Extremely affordable shopping and hotels (..seriously.)\r\n-Good, simple Mediterranean food at alarmingly low prices (good bread + our own spin on cool tzatziki yogurt sauce + fresh salads, minimum. you especially need to try roast lamb here!)\r\n-A penchant for music and dance, be it folk or techno\r\n-Weddings galore. It's the Albanians' favorite excuse to celebrate and would be an unforgettable experience\r\n\r\nAnd honestly? If there's even one year I advise you to uncover this gem of a place, it's now. 2012. It's the year of the Dragon. It's Albania's 100 year anniversary of independence. Et cetera et cetera. We're living in exciting times; go now.\r\n\r\nHere's to good traveling, good food, and good people. Gezuar! Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\nElsa\r\nmelangedevie@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n",

With the stone still in the oven, increase the temperature to the max again. After the pizza has been on the rack for ~4 minutes, remove the stone from the oven and place the pizza onto the stone. After the pizza has been on the stone for ~5 minutes, remove from the stone, and its ready to eat!\r\n\r\n\r\nShea B.\r\nAustin, TX\r\n\r\n",

Today I'd like to talk about the best news I ever received. Here it is:\r\n\r\nThere is forgiveness for my failings.\r\nThere is grace for my faults.\r\nThere is love I can't understand.\r\n\r\nThis was life-changing news for me, because at heart, I'm rotten. I'm selfish. I'm a liar. Even when I do good things, too often I do them to try to impress other people, or to try to prove to myself that I'm not that bad, even when I know deep down that I really am.\r\n\r\nPeople talk about karma; karma scares me. I'll never be a good enough person to deserve what I want. This is why this really good news changed my life.\r\n\r\nThe GOOD NEWS is that God knows me, knows all about me - and that he loves me anyway. That he offers me forgiveness if I'll just accept it. And that he offers me grace every day, and the chance to really be a\r\nchanged person.\r\n\r\nGod sent his son, Jesus, to earth for all of us. He lived a perfect life. He was the only person who karma really should've fully rewarded, and instead he died in my place, in your place. And then he didn't stay dead, but instead demonstrated the power to conquer death. One day he's going to come back to earth to set things right.\r\n\r\nThat's the best news I've ever received. It changed my life.

        "\"I think it is time for you to make another batch,\" my partner solemnly said to me this morning.\r\nI use to make it every year. It grew to be a notorious, magical, wild concoction of various mind-altering substances. Each successive year I would study nature and try to learn more about plants, natural aphrodisiacs, and things that could effect our emotions in a positive and loving way and I would experiment.\r\nSome years were definitely more successful then others but in general, as with most things, my love potion got better with time. But then I stopped making it.\r\nI am not sure why. Was it because I fell in love or because I grew up, got a real job? I don\u2019t know. I just stopped and never really thought about it again until now.\r\nOrganizing my bookshelf I came across the book I found many moons ago, at a wise womyn\u2019s garage sale, with this simple recipe outlined below.\r\n\r\n1 ounce dried damiana (Turnera diffusa) leaves\r\n1 pint vodka\r\n\u00be pint spring water\r\n\u00bd to 1 cup of honey\r\nInfuse the damiana in the vodka for five days, and then strain through a coffee filter. Set aside the vodka tincture and put the leaves to soak in the water for another five days. Stain as before. Discard the leaves. Heat the water infusion just enough to dissolve the honey. Add the amount of honey according to how sweet you wish the cordial to be. When cool combine with the vodka.\r\n\r\nI would take this cordial and combine it with a number of different ingredients. I started adding herbs to the damiana infusion. I experimented with time and the moon, scent and even the color of the final concoction.\r\nI took courses and read book on ethnobotany and learned more about our complex relationship with plants. I discovered that honeysuckle helps us get over old emotions. Basil can balance the Madonna\u2013whore complex. Cardamom oil is considered magnetic to the opposite sex. Ginger has been used as an aphrodisiac in China for three thousand years and is known to sharpen the mind and soothe the emotions.\r\nEach year the potions grew in complexity but I never bothered to write down the ingredients from one year to the next. It evolved with me.\r\nLove seemed less complex in those days. I wonder how much that had to do with these love potions.\r\n\r\n\r\nJen\r\njlp123@telus.net\r\nKamloops, BC, Canada\r\n\r\n",

        "When I was in elementary school, maybe eight or nine years old, the school threw a fun event at night. I don't remember what it was called or what activities it offered, save one: a classroom filled with hundreds of craft supplies where you could make anything you wanted. This room had fabric, pipe cleaners, paper, paints, glue, wood scraps, wire, glitter, pottery, plastic shapes\u2026 and so on. It was a kid's dream come true and I spent quite a while in the room, creating things. I don't recall what I made, but I do remember my awe at all the cool stuff in that room, and I wondered why there weren't more kids in there taking advantage of it.\r\n\r\nToday, I work at a company that is just like that room full of goodies, but for adults. It's called Sandbox Industries.\r\n\r\nSandbox is an entrepreneur's dream come true, just like that classroom was a child's. If you are fortunate enough to become a Founder-in-Residence at Sandbox, you're free to start your own company - anything you can imagine - and make use of Sandbox's metaphorical room full of craft supplies to do it. Our Startup Foundry offers development, design, copywriting, finance, PR, and social media services to entrepreneurs so that they can build whatever they want from scratch. In other words, we give founders the tools they need to start a business, and all they need to do is be creative and enterprising enough to use those tools to their advantage.\r\n\r\nIt's amazing to see what happens in an environment that is truly creative and collaborative. These entrepreneurs aren't competing against each other. They're working side-by-side toward a common goal, which means that they learn from each other's successes and mistakes as well as their own.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started searching for jobs, I had no idea there was anything this cool out there. I stumbled into Sandbox by accident, basically. And it got me to thinking\u2026 What other amazing things are out there?\r\n\r\nI hope that, if you're not excited or satisfied by what you do, you find the place that is as fun for you as Sandbox is for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nKassia\r\nChicago, IL\r\n\r\n",

To really make a difference.  To impart upon you some great piece of wisdom.  To share some new information with you.  \r\n\r\nYou have already shared so much with me, and I know that I will be learning so much more from you. So what can I do for you? I believe in treating others how you want to be treated.\r\nSo, maybe I can make you laugh?\r\n\r\nHere is my favorite joke: \r\nGeorge: Have you heard the one about the snake in the golf hole? \r\nLisa: No, I haven't. \r\nGeorge: Neither have I.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, joke telling is not my forte. The faces that I make to go along with the jokes is where my comedy lies ( I apologize if I did not use the correct form of that word...it's confusing).\r\n\r\nWhat else can I share with you? I love to bake. I often substitute coconut oil (cold pressed organic virgin) for half or all of the butter to change the flavor profile and perhaps make baked treats a little healthier. I also add a tablespoon of high quality baking powder to any recipe calling for chocolate.  This always adds a lot to the chocolate flavor!\r\n\r\nI think what I want to share the most with you is my passion. Truly and deeply, I am an artist and want nothing more than to share art with you.  Specifically, I would love to sing you a song I've written.  Since I can't sing to you, I  thought I could write down the lyrics to a song I recently wrote. You can imagine a melody, write another verse, paint a picture, make a sculpture, or ignore it. Whatever suits your fancy.\r\n\r\n\"Hey Moon\" \r\n\r\nHey, Moon! How's it going? Are you waxing? Are you waning? Have you seen the sun recently?\r\nHey, Moon! How's it going? Are you full? Are you new? Are you pulling the tide to and fro?\r\nThe stars are shining bright. I can hardly see their light beyond your beauty. My beautiful Moon.\r\nHey, Moon! How's it going?

(It might give some ideas to other students out there!)\r\n\r\nFirst one: Toad in the Hole. This one takes about 35 minutes from start to finish, incl. cooking time.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n3 fat sausages\r\n1 heaped teaspoon white flora / trex / oil (or another cooking fat)\r\n1 large egg\r\n3 fl. oz milk\r\n2 fl. oz water\r\nPinch of salt\r\n\r\n1. Heat your oven to 220 degrees\r\n2. Put the sausages in a roasting dish, and put in a heaped teaspoon of white flora (or something similar like trex). If you don't have anything like that, I've found oil works ok too.\r\n3. Put them in the oven for about 10 minutes.\r\n4. While they're cooking, put the flour, salt, egg, milk, water, and salt in a bowl together and whisk it together until all the lumps are gone. I usually need to scrape around the side of the bowl with a spoon to mix in the stuff that sticks to the sides.\r\n5. After the sausages have had their 10 minutes, pour the batter over the sausages and put it back in the oven for about 20 minutes.\r\n6. Serve with whatever you like! I like to eat it on it's own, but I've been told that's weird.\r\n\r\nSecond: spicy beef meatballs\r\nThis one isn't as simple because it needs a spice mix called ras el hanout. They don't sell it in the supermarkets around the university, but I usually pick up a pot from waitrose when I go home, and it lasts for ages. I've included it here anyway because it's really nice (it's a favourite of all my flatmates). It also takes a bit longer to cook, about an hour and 20 altogether.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n20 small beef meatballs\r\n200g cherry tomatoes\r\n1 large onion\r\n2 tsp. ras el hanout.\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 180 degrees\r\n2. Chop the onion up, and put it in the dish with the tomatoes and meatballs\r\n3. Sprinkle the ras el hanout on top\r\n4. Cover with tinfoil and put it in the oven for an hour.\r\n5. Take the tinfoil off, squash the tomatoes and give it a stir.\r\n6. Put back in the oven, without tinfoild, for another 20 minutes.\r\n7. Take out and serve with pitta breads!\r\n\r\nFinally: cookies!\r\nThis is the simplest (and one of the nicest) cookie recipes I've found.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n100g butter\r\n100g sugar\r\n1 large egg\r\n175g plain flour\r\n1/2 tsp. baking powder\r\n1 big bar of chocolate (I like dairy milk best)\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees\r\n2. Mix together the butter and sugar\r\n3. Mix in the egg\r\n4. Stir in the flour and baking powder\r\n5. Stir in the chocolate\r\n6. Cover a tray with tinfoil/greaseproof paper, put the dollops of the mixture onto the tray, and cook for 12-15 minutes.\r\n\r\nThat's all I have! Hopefully this will give some ideas to at least a few of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam Tonks\r\nadam@adam-tonks.co.uk\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Bagel Parrot: bird in the city", 
        "Jenn W.", 
        "I'm your average twentysomething living and working in Manhattan, but I won't bore you with any further details (I'll leave that to HBO). Instead, I'll introduce you to my Congo African Grey parrot, Bagel. Greys are considered one of the most intelligent species of birds, with an amazing ability to mimic speech, identify objects, and even do arithmetic. Google \"Alex the parrot\" after you read this email and you'll see what I mean.  \r\n\r\n- So, why \"Bagel\"? On a chilly Saturday morning in late December 2011, my boyfriend and I were at a loss for lunch options, per usual. We were headed east to the F train when we turned around because I decided I wanted a bagel from Brooklyn Bagels. One thing led to another, and we found ourselves at our local Petland Discounts playing with a beautiful baby African Grey*. It was only appropriate that we name our New York-born-and-bred bird after our prized breakfast staple. \r\n\r\n- Does she talk? Most definitely. She came home knowing how to say, \"hello\", \"oh boy!\", and \"I love you\", and mimicking a smoke-detector and aquarium bubbler. Since coming home, she's only picked up gibberish, curiously enough, including \"wee goo\" and \"bagel poopah\"; she has also learned to mimic coughing and a door squeak. The other day, she said some indecipherable things in a deep masculine voice; I think she picked it up from PBS, which I leave on when I go to work.    \r\n\r\n- Does she get to go outside? Yes. She's been outside a total of ~8 times, and mostly in the Chelsea area. She's also been to the Upper West Side and Fort Greene. She's still learning how to fly, but we do have a parrot harness ready for when she grows out her flight feathers. \r\n\r\n- Where can you find Bagel? On my shoulder around Chelsea. Or, on Facebook, Tumblr, and Instagram with the handle \"bagelparrot\". \r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: Bagel was not an impulse buy. I grew up with birds and had been on the market for a parrot for a while. While African Greys make amazing pets, they are so intelligent and sensitive that they may resort to self-destructive behavior if they do not get enough attention. They also live until 60, so be prepared to write them into your wills. \r\n\r\n\r\nJenn W.\r\nbagelparrot@gmail.com\r\nManhattan, NY\r\n\r\n",

We generally avoid engaging with him about all this stuff.\r\n\r\nBut, seemingly incongruously, he doesn't hate on the gays. He doesn't believe that gay folks are degenerate or sick, or make substandard parents, or should be singled out for anything. There's a refreshing absence of conspiracy theories about gay agendas. He doesn't bust out his religion to support discrimination. In fact, he's pretty progressive in his thinking that lesbians and gay men should have the same rights and responsibilities as everyone else -- I think he believes homosexuals are, for the most part, just regular folks doing their thing.\r\n\r\nHe became my father-in-law when I married his son back in 2008, when gays could marry in California. He and his wife welcomed me into their family with open arms. Now, after nearly eight years together, my husband and I are in the adoption process. We are starting a family, two dads and a baby, with friends and family. We will teach our daughter or son our values, a few of which might be very different from his.

And we can end hunger. Fascinating, right!? The generation being born right now is the first in our history that may see the basic needs of every human being met. \r\n\r\nThese are things that, once you know, you can't un-know. These are things that should inspire us all. These are things that - at Impact Foods - give us purpose. \r\n\r\nImpact Foods is a small food company in Dallas, TX with a big dream - to see the day when no children are hungry. \r\n\r\nFor every bag of granola we sell, we feed a hungry child. We do this through our partnership with the World Food Programme. We help end the cycle of hunger at three critical points:\r\n\r\n1) 1,000 Days: We target hunger in the first 1,000 days of a child's life, where damage done to the brain by malnutrition is irreversible.\r\n\r\n2) School Meals: Then, we provide meals in schools - which boosts community attendance by more than 50%.  This program allows children to receive nutrition as well as an education. \r\n\r\n3) Sustainability: Our hunger work is done in a way that treats the problem, not simply the symptoms. Our ultimate goal is to break the cycle of hunger through not only feeding children, but educating them and giving them thriving communities and self-sustaining economies so that companies like Impact Foods no longer need to exist. \r\n\r\nBut for now, they do need to exist. And we want to encourage you to start a conscious capitalism project of your own. Our passion is hunger - what's yours!? \r\n\r\nSure, we'd love for you to buy a bag of our delicious all-natural granola when it hits the shelves of Whole Foods this August...but really we want to to think about today's question:\r\n\r\nWhat IF. \r\n\r\nWhat IF you could make an Impact?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\ninfo@impactfoods.com\r\n\r\n",

        "Kip Silverman", 
        "Hi fellow ListServians!\r\n\r\nIn 1987, I was at a civil rights march in Cumming, GA (Brotherhood March II).  I was grabbed by a coordinator towards the end- I was told to flank the woman next to me who was with a child in a stroller; there were people on the ridge next to us throwing rocks and bottles and screaming obscenities. As I tried to turn my body into a shield I directly faced these people screaming the most hateful and violent words I have ever heard uttered. I thought I had understood racism and prejudice. I understood nothing.\r\n\r\nI was becoming enraged. I wanted to fight back. As I began looking for a rock or anything, a chant was growing in the stream of marchers; I expected a confrontation until I heard what they were chanting. To fight the shouts of \"Nigger Lovers\" and \"You will Hang\" was a chant of \"We Love You\" in return.\r\n\r\nI didn't understand. How can people met with lifelong hatred and discrimination act in return with Love? In the face of people threatening to kill you, they reply with \"I Love You\".\r\n\r\nI broke inside. I collapsed. The people around me grabbed me, pulled me up and helped me to my feet. I heard the words beside me \"It's okay brother, I have you\" and I regained my footing and made it to the end.\r\n\r\nThere is a picture of me sitting on a curb shortly afterward looking exhausted and dazed. 25 years later I am still exhausted and dazed.\r\n\r\nI try to inform everything I do in my life with this experience- the morals I raised my three amazing daughters with, how I still to this day try to make changes in this ever-broken world of ours.\r\n\r\nThere are so many awful things that humans do to each other. I truly believe they can only be resolved with a genuine love and caring for each other. Unequivocally, everyone should have the same opportunity to equal treatment under law, clean food and water, safe housing, health care and good education. And mutual respect. I have not ever heard a single argument to lead me to believe anything other than this.\r\n\r\nThis is the underlying theme of the Occupy Movement. It's about everything really. But most of all, it's about love and respect for us all.\r\n\r\nEmail me if you want to read some of my poems.\r\n\r\nMuch Love and Respect to you all\r\n\r\n\r\nKip Silverman\r\nkip.silverman@gmail.com\r\nPortland, Oregon\r\n\r\n",

Tell you a little about what work's been like for me lately. \r\n2. Choose and present to you some rad radio. I love NPR. I am a walking pledge drive. I am not paid by National Public Radio. They don't know who I am. So great is my love for it, though, that I'm sending the love along to all y'all. In some ways the segments I mention below are like the beginners version of radio-- Radiolab and TAL are classic NPR staples--but in other ways I feel that they represent the absolute finest in radio listening pleasure. \r\n3. Say a couple things that need to be said. \r\n\r\n\r\nReady? Ronward!\r\n\r\n1. A day of work\r\nI just got home a little while ago. A lot of my work consists of getting on the phone and talk to people. Sometimes, on these calls, I get pissed off and the forked vein in my forehead bulges (I know this because yesterday I was on a Skype conference call, and the vein popped out when I was trying to make a point that seemed really important at the time. I should probably get my blood pressure checked.) The window in my office looks right onto a lawn; a small woods starts at the edge of it, and beyond, there's a river. Every so often, when I'm sitting at my desk, two or three deer leap out of the foliage and nibble at leaves. I take pictures of them with my camera phone. Generally, the pictures do not turn out. \r\n\r\n2. This is NPR\r\nListen to THIS WHOLE SHOW: Radiolab, Season 6, Episode 2 'After Life'\r\nBe obsessive about THESE 14 SECONDS: Radiolab's original open, particularly the part where the lady says \"and this is NPR\". \r\nExperience the WEIGHT-LIFTING SNOWMAN: \"We did it!\", This American Life, Episode 323, Act 2, 'Super Duper'\r\nRegularly make yourself an actual good American by listening to THIS SHOW ALL THE TIME: American Roots\r\n\r\n3. The truth of the matter is:\r\nCompassion and forgiveness are the most important things. \r\nThe Hunger Games trilogy had engrossing, even great stories... but they were not actually that good as books. \r\n\r\nListen for the win,\r\n\r\n\r\nMax\r\nMaxineandtheradio@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Thoughts of one of the happiest guys in the world", 
        "Jacob Markussen", 
        "I've thought about what to write in this email ever since I signed up to the list, and to selected this early in the list is both awesome and a little frightening, because I don't really feel ready. Nevertheless, this is my contribution, and it will hopefully be of some kind of use you!\r\n\r\nWhen I got the mail about being selected, the first thing I had to do was to decide what I wanted to write about. Should I tell a story? Write about my life and ambitions? Tell about the company I am starting? Why I think my education is awesome? Or why I love developing for Android?\r\n\r\nIt was a hard choice, but I finally made up my mind \u2013 to tell something I usually don't write about, something I know I am admired for all bragging set aside.\r\n\r\nSo I chose to write a little about my way of life, and why I think it makes me the one of the happiest guys in the world.\r\n\r\nSure, the past 26 years have been mostly great for me, but there has sure been some lows down the road already. But no matter what has happened I have kept my spirits high, and with a healthy faith in life I have made it all the way till today. To put it in a little perspective, here is a short summary of one of the worst weeks of my life so far:\r\n\r\nIt started out great, with plans to go the Crete with my beautiful girlfriend for a week, taking of Sunday morning. On Tuesday some idiot broke in to my car an stole a lot of stuff, including my laptop (yeah, it was hidden) and set me back around $3500. On the following Saturday one of my teeth started to hurt, and at around 8 in the evening I couldn't stand the pain. The result was a root canal, a canceled holiday not covered by the insurance because it happened before I left the country in total setting me back another $2000. And all of this while being a student having $900 a month for everything. But I kept my spirits high, because there are more important things in life.\r\n\r\nAnd what is it then? Well, it is kinda hard to explain, but basically my philosophy in life is stay happy. Not at any cost, but if there is something to be happy about, why spend time moaning about what has gone wrong? It kinda works like this; when something goes wrong, I focus only on the good things that results from whatever and let the bad stuff happen as something that need to get done to get to the good stuff. For example, I was just glad that the lady at the emergency room gave my both penicillin and very strong painkillers that got me through the night, and that the dentist gave a completely painless root canal the day after leaving me with a fixed tooth and no pain at all.\r\n\r\nSo, what I am actually trying to say here is that life is awesome, and if you can control the way you think about things, you can actually stay on the good side of almost anything. It works for me anyway!\r\n\r\nBe positive, and spread it with a smile! It WILL get you further!\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob \"Jam\" Markussen\r\nAarhus, Denmark\r\n\r\n",

Go to school. Go to work. Do homework. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Repeat.\r\n\r\nI mean people have warned me that life out of high school sucked, but no one could have really prepared me for this. While my peers are out of state at some fancy University, having the time of their lives partying, drinking, and networking with a variety of people.. I am here, stuck on this rock, going to a community college, and living paycheck to paycheck.\r\n\r\nI was told that doing great things in high school would amount to great things out of high school, but that was just a way of getting me to go to class. I\u2019ve done sports, I was a vital role in the school\u2019s yearbook, I was enrolled in advanced placement classes, I participated in numerous clubs (service/leisure), I have held leadership positions in those clubs, always went out of my way to volunteer, and I even represented the state in a national competition and placed 3rd overall.\r\n\r\nAll these things may have been a great experience for me, but it just sucks knowing that it all amounted to this. Here I am. Stuck.\r\n\r\nAlthough my life isn\u2019t the greatest at this moment, I like to look at it knowing that it could be worse. I mean there is always someone out there in the world that has it worse, just as there is always someone in the world who has it better. This sort of gives me a modest way of looking at life: I am not walking around with my nose up in the air nor am I moping around hoping everyone takes pity on me.\r\n\r\nAs for the quote above, I don\u2019t really know what Picasso meant by it. I\u2019m guessing that it takes a very long time until you actually get to understand the meaning of all of this crap. And that it takes a very long time for you to actually enjoy life because we have to work for it.. That you know, we will have the opportunity to be \u2018youthful\u2019 when are have finally made a name for ourselves. When we stop trying to please everyone and start doing things just for the hell of it.\r\n\r\nWhile typing this, I\u2019ve realized how dull my life has become and that\u2019s just no bueno. So although life has been stressful let\u2019s try to remember the fun in life \u2013and let\u2019s not get all caught up in this shit. I think with a balance of work and fun, time will be that much bearable.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nKurtis Katakura\r\nKrtsKtkra@gmail.com\r\nHonolulu, Hawaii\r\n\r\n",

When people ask me why I always say that when I take a step, he hops.\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s a story behind that.\r\n\r\nI was tree planting one year. While planting you need to move fast, the more trees in the ground the more money you would make. I was never all that great at it but I stuck with it and at the very least I kept going.\r\n\r\nOne rainy day, on a hill surrounded by tree stumps and torn up branches, I threw my shovel into the ground to open up space in the dirt for a little tree but as the blade of my shovel came down a frog hopped onto the path. The shovel came down onto his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe frog\u2019s arm was cut off. Not completely, though, there was a small flap of muscle/skin hanging on (if you\u2019ve ever read Harry Potter, think of Nearly Headless Nick) and the frog was wriggling around on the ground, likely in a lot of pain.\r\n\r\nI was a little shocked. I stared at the frog a little while, and it never made a sound. I looked around, walking a few steps to see if someone was nearby. Probably for moral support, but I hadn\u2019t really thought that far ahead. I didn\u2019t know if I should try to kill the frog, knowing that with it\u2019s injury it would be easy prey and have difficulty moving around to get it\u2019s own food. I decided to go back to check on the frog.\r\n\r\nHe was gone, somehow moving himself back into the brush. I still wonder if his arm wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought. Either way, he'll figure things out for himself.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had other tragedies in my life, ones that easily surpass the armless frog in the scale of life changes and impact, but the frog gave me things to think about, which turned into something that I learned.\r\n\r\nThe memory of that frog comes with me every time I take a step forward. Bad things will happen, you must remember them but don\u2019t ever stop moving forward. Things will sort themselves out as long as you do.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019ll remind me, when things get troublesome, to keep hopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nVera Suzanne\r\narevera.vera@gmail.com\r\nOntario, Canada\r\n\r\n",

Sometimes the virtual is a good substitute and other times, there is simply nothing that replaces the feelings and the ideas that can flow during a conversation had within a single room. However, the more time we spend in the virtual, the easier it becomes to dismiss the value of coming together in physical spaces.\r\n\r\nWhile working away deep in the virtual, an interdisciplinary group of friends brought me to join them in POPSHOP, the place where we go to work, play, talk, sleep\u2026 sometimes, and most importantly work together physically. It\u2019s a place where we can build, where dreams are celebrated, but only if they are followed up by action. Where ideas are great, but not as great as the process of building, of showing others, even if not for monetary gain but for the physical feeling of building. It is our firm belief that the only way to really move quickly, is by sharing with others and by allowing them to help catalyze growth. Leveraging the knowledge of others not for an explicit reciprocity, but an implicit one. Being together physically not only lets us better share our ideas and help each other, but it actually has a really powerful effect. It is that extra level of commitment that drives us to not only talk about our ideas, but take action and make sure we achieve our dreams, and when we get stuck have people around to help us move forward.\r\n\r\nSo poprightin online to see more and make sure you physically get together with a group representing diverse ideas and skills, to see how much more you can achieve.\r\n\r\nP.S. I wrote this in the POPSHOP with the help of some of the awesome people around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Sinensky\r\nsam.sinensky@gmail.com\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Worry Less, Do More", 
        "Kris Noble", 
        "It's often said that the biggest obstacles we face in life are the ones we put up for ourselves. Unnecessary worry is one of those.\r\n\r\nHow many times have you denied yourself an opportunity because of worry - maybe you felt like you weren't ready, or that you didn't deserve something enough?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to that question is \u201cnever\u201d then you're very lucky indeed but most people  have held themselves back on many an occasion. Personally, towards the end of last year I was holding myself back to the point where I was hardly doing anything new or creative, stuck in a self-imposed rut.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying we should try to never worry about anything, because it's perfectly natural to worry sometimes, and certain things in life will always cause anxiety.\r\n\r\nWhat's important is to learn to realise when we're worrying unnecessarily and devise strategies for dealing with it in a productive way.\r\n\r\nThose strategies will be unique to you, so you'll have to work them out yourself. It's really easy though \u2013 all you need to do is take a little \u201cquiet time\u201d whenever you feel worried, frame your worry into a statement and then come up with a logical solution.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\u201cI'm worried that if I go for a job interview I might mess it up and make myself look stupid\u201d\r\nStrategy: \u201cSo I will make sure I'm fully prepared for my interview and perhaps roleplay with a friend so I can practise\u201d\r\n\r\nQuite often I find that just turning a vague worry into a definitive statement makes the solution obvious.\r\n\r\nOf course, sometimes you really aren't ready for that new job, or physically fit enough to run that marathon \u2013 but at least this way you have some kind of action plan.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the hang of dealing with minor worries in this way, you should find that you'll spend less time thinking about doing stuff, and more time actually doing stuff.\r\n\r\nYou won't always succeed, but if you're worrying less and doing more, failure is just a side effect of all the awesome new things you're experiencing rather than a crushing defeat.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, I hope you'll join me in worrying less and doing more! I'd love to hear about your thoughts and experiences so please get in touch :)\r\n\r\n\r\nKris Noble\r\nkrisnoble@gmail.com\r\nLondon, UK\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] No time to mourn our humble existence", 
        "Philipp", 
        "After 13 years of flying to the edge of our solar system, the American Voyager 1 space probe, reached the almost incomprehensible distance of 6.4 billion kilometres (nearly 4 billion miles) from Earth in 1990 and was turned around to take a picture of our home planet. Earth is no more than a pale blue dot, hardly to be seen against the cosmic background.\r\n\r\nThe insignificance of our planet in the truly fascinating happenings of the universe becomes more clear, when trying to comprehend, that the Milky Way, which can be seen on a clear night, is in fact what a spiral galaxy looks like from the inside! It may contain up to 400 billion stars \u2013 one of them, is our sun.\r\n\r\nAnd then, on one of the sun's planets, there are humans. When contemplating the irrelevance of every single being on earth against the immense numbers that the universe provides, our mind protests, that this can not be so. But with all the evidence we have from hundreds of years of exploring the night sky, we have to come to the conclusion, that it is.\r\n\r\nSome people feel small because the universe is so big. But in our each and every life, there is no time to mourn our humble existence, nor to believe that of all possible life forms in the universe, just we are the selected species. Let us accept the fact, that we are a very small part of the universe and concentrate on our life and the lives of people we love and care for, making our home planet a more peaceful place to live.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we are forced to get along together. There is no way of escaping our home planet and, as yet, there is nowhere else to reach besides our pale blue dot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilipp\r\nptn.planet@googlemail.com\r\nPassau, Germany\r\n\r\n",

        "I am an avid reader of The Listserve. I love the concept of the group and I love receiving each day's email. So far I've learned so much from so many strangers - drink recipes with ingredients I would never have thought of, more information about bees and beekeeping than I ever thought I'd learn, the list goes on and on. \r\n\r\nWhile I always hoped that one day I'd be selected to send out an email - I didn't expect the time to come so soon. To me, the chance to email almost 20,000 people in countries ranging from Belarus to Cambodia to Lebanon to Nigeria is an incredible one. It's the 21st century equivalent of being given a microphone to talk to a massive audience of people from around the world, people that you'd never normally meet. A really amazing opportunity, but also one with quite a bit of pressure. I have to be honest, when I received the email yesterday afternoon, I panicked. What could I possibly tell people that they didn't already know? I'm 22 years old - how many incredible life experiences do I have that would be inspiring to 20,000 others? \r\n\r\nSome of my favorite Listserve emails so far have been those that contain inspiring pieces of advice based off of the sender's own experiences. I just graduated from college and I'm at a point in my life when I feel very young and very old at the same time. I have my whole life ahead of me, but now it's largely up to me to determine what my future will look like. I know I have a lot to share, but I also know that I have even more to learn. So, accordingly, I decided to solicit members of my own family - ranging from grandparents to aunts to parents to siblings - for pearls of wisdom that they've learned throughout their own lives. I figured that it might be more worthwhile to share inspiring quotes based off of over 250 years of experience, than just 22.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of my favorites:\r\n\r\n\"Walk through life being pleasant and kind to everyone you meet, knowing that your kindness will not only make someone else's life better, but also your own.\" - Morrie Zimring\r\n\r\n\"Keep on going, even if you feel like there is no tomorrow.\" - Susan Sale\r\n\r\n\"Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves.\" - Muriel Zimring\r\n\r\n\"When you lose, don't lose the lesson.\" - Miki Zimring\r\n\r\n\"Everything you're looking for lies behind the mask that you wear.\" - Miki Zimring\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it's shit till it isn't shit anymore.\" - Lori Sale\r\n\r\n\"An unsolicited opinion is hardly ever heeded or valued.\" - Scott Sale\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for the opportunity to speak to you all - I'd love to hear back from anyone and everyone. This is a great group and I'm honored to be a part of it!\r\n\r\nJordan Sale \r\n\r\n22 years old\r\nFrom: Los Angeles, CA\r\nMoving to: Washington, DC\r\nCurrently in: Chiang Mai, Thailand!\r\nalisesalejordan@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",

It will probably make you cry, but it will also make you laugh. It's an honor to share in this story. You'll fall in love with it.\r\n\r\nWater for Elephants by Sara Gruen\r\nThis is one of the most engaging stories I've read. It follows a young man who ends up working in the circus, but the best thing about it is that it also follows his life much later on in a nursing home. The way the two stories intersect is fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe Book Thief by Markus Zusak\r\nThis is about a girl during WWII told from Death's point of view. Nothing else is like it. It will break you heart, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\nA Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson\r\nOr anything by him. He's hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams\r\nIt seemed obligatory to put this on the list, as Towel Day was so recent.\r\n\r\nSince so many others have given life advice, I feel as though I should do so as well. The only advice I feel comfortable giving comes from two video bloggers, John and Hank Green, who changed my life and introduced me to the best community in the world. Google them, check it out.

        "You just landed in India. You\u2019re a bit stressed: it\u2019s absolutely normal. But let me just tell you a simple thing, and everything will go just fine. In a matter of days, the Indian in you will be fully awakened.\r\n\r\nThe head tilt.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple gesture: just tip your head from side to side with a small angle (around 15\u00b0), repeatedly. Don\u2019t make it start at the top of the head; your chin should be driving the movement. Limit yourself to three or four tilts, in a fluid movement. Got it? Yes, you\u2019re doing it right.\r\n\r\nYou just learnt the secret to Indian communication. A stranger is talking to you in an unknown language? Just concur, using your newly learnt skill. Congratulations! You successfully communicated. Look at the visible satisfaction in your new friend\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nHuh? You still don\u2019t understand what it means? You\u2019re puzzled by this taxi driver\u2019s use of the gesture when you give your destination? Was it \u201cyes\u201d, was it \u201cno\u201d?\r\n\r\nNo, you\u2019re not getting it: it doesn\u2019t have a meaning, because it IS the language. Does English have a meaning?\r\n\r\nBut the comparison with English stops here. The tilt head is much more powerful. What other language allows you to communicate \u201cI reluctantly agree to the price you have given me, but be aware you get all my contempt\u201d with such concision?\r\n\r\nWarning: Excessive use of the tilt head may severely impair your communication skills back at home. Use at your own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nArthur Cheysson\r\narthur@cheysson.fr\r\nNew Delhi, India\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "I'm generally not big on quoting other people, and maybe this is totally cheesy, but this poem contains what I find to be useful pointers on how to go about life. It's not clever, it doesn't rhyme, it's not grandiose. It's eloquent and on point:\r\n\r\nDesiderata\r\nGo placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.\r\n\r\nIf you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\r\n\r\nExercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\r\n\r\nNurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.\r\n\r\nTherefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams; it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.\r\n\r\nStrive to be happy.\r\n\r\n--Max Ehrmann, 1927\r\n\r\n\r\nSunaina\r\nlanainer@gmail.com\r\nSan Francisco, CA\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We went to the Zoo, and the Powerhouse Museum (absolutely fantastic for a young kid into technology and science like I was and am), and many many other places.  Most importantly, we were spending time as a family.  I look back on the trip with the absolute fondness of memories.  And with a little regret.\r\n\r\nNot about the trip, no, let me explain.  We were heading back to the hotel after a long days adventuring.  My brother and I could be a little bit (ok, a lotta bit) of a handful when we were young, and this particular day was no different; So you can understand why when the train arrived at the station, I just stepped on.  Or rather, into the gap between the platform and the train.\r\n\r\nI don't remember much about it; what I do remember is falling, and in the same instant a fist grabbing my t-shirt from behind and pushing me up onto the train.  My ankle and knee was sore and my eyes were filling with tears as Mum snatched me up and took me to seat.  Dad was shaking the hand of the man who had saved, at the very least, my leg.\r\n\r\nI remember laying on the hotel bed watching cartoons as Dad iced my leg.\r\n\r\nMy regret is never being able to thank that man for saving my life; or at the very least, saving my leg.\r\n\r\n\r\nJamie Reid\r\napoc2.0@gmail.com\r\nCanberra, Australia\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] A few things to remember...", 
        "Anonymous", 
        "1. Watch for bikers and runners when you drive.  Too many accidents occur because people are making a simple turn and are in a hurry, and forget to look to see who else they share the road with.  If you see a biker or runner, don't forget to check where they are before you turn in front of them, otherwise you could turn right in front of them and badly injure someone (not to mention put a nasty dent in your car).\r\n\r\n2. Don't drink and drive. It doesn't matter if you've only had two drinks.  If you think you're okay to drive, wait a half hour to be sure.  The next time you think about getting into a car, think about if you found out when you got home that your son/daughter/brother/sister/best friend was killed by a drunk driver.  Just don't risk it.\r\n\r\n3. Help others.  One of my favorite quotes is by Shirley Chisholm: \"Service to others is the rent we pay for our room here on earth.\"  It doesn't matter who you are or how hard you've worked to get where you are, someone out there has fewer opportunities than you.  Everyone has someone else to thank for where they have gotten in life: your parents for raising you in a good environment and working to give you a college degree or good values, a teacher or mentor who helped you realize your passion, a nameless patron who donated scholarship money or gave you a job.  But not everyone receives the same opportunities, and everyone at least deserves to be fed, to be educated, to have a roof over their head.  It may seem that one person can not make a change, but one person can be a friend or make a small difference in one other person's life, and that's all that matters.\r\n\r\n4. Send a card or letter to someone you care about, just to let them know they matter and you are thinking about them.  Not tomorrow, do it today.  Tomorrow might be too late.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\nBuffalo, NY\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] A little anecdote from my time in Vietnam", 
        "David", 
        "A couple of months ago, my friend Jill told me to sign up this Listserve thingy \u2013 she said the writing is pretty good. Indeed it has been, I have really enjoyed receiving all the emails.\r\n\r\nI've decided I'm gonna tell a story. In summer 2010, I went backpacking for a month in Indochina with my mate, Eston. On one bit of the journey, we left Phonsavan in Laos at 6am in the morning and travelled all day to get back into Vietnam. We arrived at Vinh at 8pm in the evening, and caught yet another coach to Hoi An after waiting around for two hours.\r\n\r\nSo, we were on this coach, seated on the back row, exhausted and grubby. The driver came round the bus and gave us blankets, which we placed on the seat next to us. Two teenage boys, around our age got on and sat next to us. We couldn't really understand each other but they offered us gum - very friendly guys. We gesture and converse monosyllabically for a bit.\r\n\r\nThis coach was a bit different, it had a large space between the last row of seats and the penultimate row, large enough for a mat and for people to lie down, which the two boys did. I fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the night and in the darkness of the moving coach, I saw one of the Vietnamese boys kneeling and relieving himself into a plastic bag held by the other boy. Oops. I didn't want to be rude and stare so I closed my eyes again, opening them again to see the bag being flung out of the open window. Then I saw the other boy using one of the blankets to wipe the floor. I'm guessing he spilt the bag. The boys shifted elsewhere on the mat, away from the wet spot and went back to sleep.\r\n\r\nLater I woke up again, this time, the driver was chasing the two boys away from lying down (it was a long ride so I assumed he was rotating his driving shift with someone else). He appeared to scold them, and then after they moved back to their seats, he lay down on the mat \u2013 right over the 'wet' spot!\r\n\r\nAt this point I was stifling my laughter, terrified the driver would smell something and accuse Eston and me. I don't think I would have been able to remain poker-faced in the face of interrogation. I was also really glad I didn't use the blankets given.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, I had a great month of travelling. If you ever get the opportunity, do visit Indochina, especially Laos!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid\r\ndinosaur.lipstick@gmail.com\r\nLancaster, UK\r\n\r\n",

It is actually the spark of divine inspiration, expressing itself out of one\u2019s heart, or the involuntary feeling of awe, in reaction to an inspiring piece of art or music.\r\n\r\nTenalach (Gaeilge)- The relationship one has with the earth, the air, the water. A deep connection that makes you one with nature.\r\n\r\nGem\u00fctlich (German)- Translates as \"comfortable\", but it is the sort of comfortable exhibited by a warm house full of people who love you; when you are happy and relaxed.\r\n\r\nYa'aburnee (Arabic)- Literally translates as \"You bury me.\"  The declaration of one's hope that they'll die before another person, because of how difficult it would be to live without them.\r\n\r\nKoi No Yokan (Japanese)- The feeling you can get when meeting a person for the first time, that you will fall in love with them. Different from \"love at first sight\", as it does not say that love already exists, only the knowledge that it WILL happen later.\r\n\r\nOn that note, I'll sign off.

        "My favorite English professor taught me to write like Hemingway.  Few words and active verbs make perfect sentences. \r\n\r\nSenior year, I had to write an essay, one conveying a sense of time and place, in the style of Joan Didion. Inspired by my respect for the professor and enthralled by Didion, I wrote a harshly honest account - my struggles with weight, food, responsibility - and anger at parental pressure. peer pressure and career pressure.   The title, \"Often, That Problem Is Mine,\"  referenced a joke between my friend Scott - also in the class - and me.  The totally awkward, poorly-constructed sentence summed up everything we wrote and thought about, while mocking the passive, unmanly writing styles we had certainly transcended.  \r\n\r\nMy professor gave me an A and encouraged me to publish it.  He seemed truly enthusiastic, convinced it would make a great op-ed in the New York Times.  \r\n\r\nLacking confidence, and still fearing parents' wrath, publishers' rejection and professional repudiation, I demurred, dodged and dropped the idea.\r\n\r\nI failed to follow-through, and now I wonder what might have been.\r\n\r\nOften, that problem is mine.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCathleen Rittereiser \r\ncathleen@cathleenritt.com \r\nNew York City  \r\n\r\n",

Of course, we aren't utopian yet, and I see things in people's characters that I think to myself often, but now have a place to widely broadcast!\r\n\r\nThe founder of western philosophy said, \"I know one thing, that I know nothing.\" Yet many people I meet (including myself) can think that there's something you know, something that sets oneself apart, that somehow lends authority to judge or critique someone else's beliefs, actions, or decisions.\r\n\r\nMay I humbly suggest that none of us know the inner workings of every human heart. Religious zealots may have been indoctrinated, the poor may be so because they support others, and the classically uneducated may be wiser than their lack of a degree may evince.\r\n\r\nIf I could share something from my life experience that I think could help all of you, it would be to not only to treat people justly and rightly, but also with respect. I've had personal experiences with people who, in retrospect, have been astonishingly wiser than I, but who were easy to dismiss because they had learned that wisdom is its own qualifier, and weren't competing for something as fleeting as honor or recognition.\r\n\r\nKind regards, Anonymous\r\n\r\nAlbuquerque, NM \r\ntjl@byu.net\r\n\r\n",

        "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nLike many others, I didn't expect to be selected this early, so here's something I learned from Bruce and Sophie. Who are they, you ask? Well, they're my cats. And before you file me under \"Crazy Cat Guy\" I want to share a couple things that I didn't\r\n\r\nknow before I adopted them.\r\n\r\n- Cats are obligate carnivores. - Cats are desert animals, and as such, they don't have a high thirst drive. - Cats on an all kibble diet do not drink enough water and are\r\n\r\nmore prone to being dehydrated. - Dry food is has a really high percentage of carbs that cats dont really need.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did I learn this from them? Well Sophie had some stomach issues that wouldn't go away, regardless of the brand of food I fed her, so I went into research mode and read about cat nutrition and such. As a result of all this, I moved them both to a strict canned food diet and then I started making their food at home. Yes, homemade cat food. Raw chicken with extra additives that they need. The net result of this? Her stomach problems vanished pretty much overnight. Not only that but both her and Bruce's coat is super soft and shiny,\r\n\r\nthere's not a person who pets them that doesn't comment on it.\r\n\r\nI don't expect everyone to start making their own cat food because that's just unrealistic, but for all of you cat lovers out there, think about switching them to an all wet food diet, at least. Its not as convenient and is a bit more expensive than dry, but it's way better\r\n\r\nbetter for them. Canned food has a far higher protein content than dry, as well as having a lot more water to it which will help keep them hydrated, this in turn will help keep urinary tract diseases at bay. Not only that but most canned food has about 4% carbohydrates in it, as opposed to 30% or more on dry food.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo please, look into it. Wet food is the way to go. Don't take my word for it either, google \"cat info\" and the first hit will have lots of info on the subject, read up on it, the site is maintained by Dr. Lisa Pierson and is an invaluable resource.\r\n\r\nYour kitties will thank you for it. You wouldn't eat junk food your entire life, and neither should your cats.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlos Anicama \r\ndevilchicken@gmail.com \r\nTacoma, Wa.\r\n\r\n",

After the vision, I moved to Portland to get a PhD in systems science, and in two years when I finish my dissertation, I'll be traveling the country to foment a (r)evolution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI was teaching the students a basic four part problem solving method:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHAVE a problem.\r\n\r\nIDENTIFY what you KNOW\r\n\r\nIDENTIFY what is NEEDED\r\n\r\nSTRATEGIZE what to do\r\n\r\nSOLVE (act on the problem)\r\n\r\nVERIFY that the problem is correct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen I noticed something interesting - these items form a set of recursive domains, 'meta' if you will. People move smoothly from having a problem, to filtering it towards a goal, towards planning and then acting, and after acting, reflecting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen I noticed that this is a fundamental relationship in the processing of groups - whether we talk of group identity (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing) or the way in which Portland, OR has processed through the building of a new I-5 bridge (ODOT declares a problem, neighborhood mtgs, design meetings, construction meetings, construction!)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis basic pattern is nothing less than the operating of the hivemind, a prosaic and yet fundamental relationship in how humans compute. I believe that change in possible in my lifetime, and that I'll be the one to foment that change.

        "Hello Listserve!\r\n\r\nI'm writing this from my hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand. First trip out of Australia and I'm loving it! \r\n\r\nLast night we dropped in to The Shakespeare for a quick beer on the walk home.  Wow, What a pub! They brew their own beer in behind the bar. If you're in the area I highly recommend it.\r\n\r\nBrewing beer is a very rewarding hobby which I recommend every beer lover try at least once. I don't mean those tins of extract you get from the supermarket, brew it from grain! The experience really helped me enjoy some of the excellent craft beers available to us now. \r\n\r\nI tried the 'brew in a bag' method in a large pot on my stove. It only brewed about 24 bottles but they were mine! I had a great time adding the ingredients and seeing how it changed the flavours before and after it was bottled. \r\n\r\nThe first pour and taste was so rewarding, I had no idea if I had done it right or wrong or what to expect. To have this beer that I crafted myself from raw ingredients was the best thing ever. \r\n\r\nGo on, give it a crack. It'll only cost you about $50 to get set up and a day of your time. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\r\nJake H. \r\njake.shud@gmail.com \r\nQLD, Australia\r\n(currently Auckland, New Zealand)\r\n\r\nOh, and Sarah, I love you with all my heart :)\r\n\r\n",

Cooking dinner parties out of our home in New York (and occasionally on the road) has afforded the chance to stay better connected with old friends, meet new ones, and explore the world\u2019s diversity from our own small kitchen.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re from a country whose cuisine we haven\u2019t cooked yet, or at least have some on-the-ground experience there, we\u2019d really appreciate your help in compiling a menu, learning your traditions around the table, maybe even compiling a playlist of music to enjoy while we eat. While I can find the green plantains, Vegeta, fenugreek and palm oil, the seasoning of your traditions, memories, and advice will add the missing flavor to help our project do even more to span cultures and delight palates.\r\n\r\nThank you and bon app\u00e9tit!\r\n\r\n\r\nJesse Friedman\r\nunitednoshes@gmail.com\r\nBrooklyn, NY, USA\r\n\r\n* We\u2019re also recognizing the two permanent observers, Palestine as a full dinner and the Holy See as a wine-and-wafer appetizer to Honduras.

Many students of mine never really used email in the first place, choosing SMS, IM, Twitter, Facebook and the like to telecommunicate with their peers.  (My fear with all of this is that we are segmenting and tying ourselves to proprietary commercial platforms (at least in the case of IM, Twitter, Facebook maybe not with SMS) without even considering the repercussions.)\r\n\r\nI love the constraints that The Listserve puts on the messages.  No links, no rich text or images and so on.  Back to the basics.  Our only mode of interaction is the reply button.  Fantastic!\r\n\r\nSo, if you will, humor me and send a reply!

You'll have time to think of something.\r\n\r\nAnd then it appears in your inbox asking to speak to hundreds of people. Some of whom will read and smile. And some of whom will think you're a blithering idiot. And some will think you have something interesting to say. And some will delete it without reading. And some won't understand.\r\n\r\nAnd it's okay.\r\n\r\nIt's okay not to be read. It's okay not to have everything work out as you planned. It's okay not to be liked by everyone.\r\n\r\nIt's okay.

An age that sits solidly in what most consider middle age. Ancient to the 20 somethings and younger, in the prime of life to those already there and past. I'm not concerned with getting older. I enjoy the experience, the knowledge, the gift of being able to say that I'm closer to a half century of existence than not.\r\n\r\nBut I haven't done anything spectacular. I haven't devoted my life to curing childhood cancer. I'm not a famous politician or entertainer. I'm not a stunning businessman or scientist. I'm just fairly ordinary.\r\n\r\nAnd that's okay.\r\n\r\nI have a calm life, one that is creative and interesting. One that doesn't make for a good answer to that question of 'what's new?' or 'what do you do?' at parties, but one that leaves me generally content.\r\n\r\nAnd that's okay.\r\n\r\nSo dream big, Do All The Things, but it's /okay/ if that Big Dream is something little and not earth shattering.

A friend recently told me this was his favourite story. I spent my 20s working in a school for children with various special needs. Twice a year we would take some of them to an outdoor adventure centre where we would climb, tunnel, drive quad-bikes etc. It was awesome. And very dirty. Hence we would shower the kids every night.\r\nOne boy I worked with, who was about 8, had various digestive medical conditions that resulted in him wearing a nappy and often suffering discomfort. At the end of one day he was in a toilet cubicle both undressing for his shower and using the facilities. Suddenly he called out to me, in a lot of distress, that his bottom was stinging (This is not the funny part!). I hurried him into the shower and rinsed him down with water relieving him of his agony. He was very thankful and continued to shower as normal.\r\nMany weeks later, I was helping out in his classroom when out of the blue, he said to me \u0093Do you remember when you were in the shower with me and I was crying because my bottom hurt?\u0094\r\n3.

Of course, people differ in their views for how they think their countries should progress, but in closing I think this quote from Voltaire will be to most people\u2019s liking: \u201cI may not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.\u201d\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid\r\nAplucsued@gmail.com\r\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] In praise of big fish in small ponds", 
        "Keith Kahn-Harris", 
        "Dear The Listserve people\r\n\u00a0\r\nI doubt you'll recognise my name.\r\n\u00a0\r\nI'm not famous. I'll never be famous.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut I have always aspired to be 'someone', a person who made some kind of small but significant contribution to 'something' . As it happened, I found such a modest niche. I'm a sociologist, working on two very specialised areas - the sociology of hevy metal and the sociology of the British Jewish community. Needless to say, there aren't many of us working in either area. I'm really just a reasonably big fish in a couple of pretty small ponds.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo for the last few years I've made a joke about being such a big fish in a small pond. I've said that really I'm just like 'the best water skier in Luxembourg'. Needless to say I didn't know anything about water skiing in Luxembourg.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut about a year ago I had a brianstorm: why not go and meet the best water skier in Luxembourg? Why not write a book about him/her and about other big fish in small ponds too? The idea seized me with excitement. This could be a polemic against power and celebrity, a celebration of the unknown heroes in obscure small worlds, a tribute to commitment and community.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo I've been working on the book. I actually met the best water skier in Luxembourg last year and I'm preparing further trips to visit such other obscure figures as the Icelandic special forces, the top novelist in Suriname and the best heavy metal band in Botswana.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe book is being crowd-funded so I need the help of strangers to complete my project. You can't post links on The Listserve but if you google 'best water skier in Luxembourg' or e-mail me, you can find out more.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the meantime thank you to The Listerserve for making me a little bit famous for one e-mail.\r\n\u00a0\r\nYours\r\n\u00a0\r\nKeith Kahn-Harris\r\nLondon, UK\r\nkkahnharis@yahoo.co.uk\r\n\r\n",

Not one jot. Would I rather have known these things would happen to me? Not if you paid me.

        "[The Listserve] Talking to Strangers", 
        "David Karger", 
        "I'm a professor at MIT; I study how people share information online and am optimistic about better communication helping to create a better world.  But paradoxically, as ever more novel communication technologies are emerging, there are serious breakdowns in meaningful communication.\r\n\r\nThe United States shows an ever-widening schism between political left and right who refuse to even talk to each other, let alone compromise in tackling national challenges.  Blogs are hyper-partisan, speaking only to the true believers and reinforcing their preconceptions.   Social network tools like Twitter and Facebook are great for chatting with friends about inconsequentialities, but actually decrease our tendency to pay attention *outside* our social circle.  When is the last time you used social media to change the mind of someone who disagreed with you about something that actually mattered?\r\n\r\nI signed up for The Listserve to help me think about tools that could enhance communication among strangers.  It's great to communicate to a huge group of listeners.  But what's next?  How could this turn into a multi-way conversation?  What about a blog where one random person posted every day but everyone could respond in the comments?  With 20,000 people on the list, how could we handle everyone talking at once?  What are the tradeoffs between picking a random sender versus using social moderation to choose the \"best\" one, whatever that means?   How could this large group work together to map out the pros and cons of an important issue and decide on a best policy? \r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Karger\r\nkarger@mit.edu\r\nCambridge, MA, USA\r\n\r\n",

My favourite question to ask is \u201cWhat are you passionate about?\u201d It stumps people most of the time. This upsets me because I don\u2019t like to see a disconnect between someone and what makes them the most happy and curious in life. Your passions should always be within arm\u2019s reach. Once I get the ball rolling and someone begins opening up to me, I like to think that I\u2019ve lightened their mood and distracted them from whatever negative thoughts were tossing in their heads. Maybe when they\u2019re done speaking to me, they continue the conversation within themselves. Perhaps they had lost touch with what they are passionate about and I helped rekindle their fire.\r\n\r\nI initially wanted to write about what was a long distance relationship between my boyfriend and I, but is now local. 286 days in our first year were spent with him in Ottawa and me in Vancouver.

        "[The Listserve] A story about music, youth and culture", 
        "Tom Davenport", 
        "This is a story about music. It is also a call to arms for anyone interested in recording. Forward it to anyone it might help.\r\n\r\nA lot is said about DIY music, and plenty more about mainstream artists. But this is a story about the rung beneath all that; a rarely mentioned rite of passage for anyone who has performed a note of music in their life.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 12, a youth club opened by our school. It had a music room where a member of staff showed me how to play a simple drum beat. I didn't 'get' music as a kid, but then they started playing along with the baseline to 'Smoke on the Water'.\r\n\r\nSomething clicked. It was a huge rush, and I feel it again as I write this.\r\n\r\nA decade later I was taking a degree in music production. My classmates wanted to be songwriters or DJs, but my love for bands like At the Drive-In and Fugazi led me to a certain music culture based in Washington DC through the 1980s. There is plenty of literature describing DC's punk heritage (everyone from Beastie Boys to Moby were part of it), but it was essentially a community defining their own identity through DIY record labels and live shows.\r\n\r\nThrough an academic lens, I picked apart why this movement worked. It needed a town to call home, a live music venue to draw people together, a studio to document their efforts, and a bunch of people who are more interested in music than money. And then I remembered the now-defunct youth club I used to visit.\r\n\r\nSo a week before graduation, I put myself to work. I wrote a proposition on the Sunday (I find the funding, you provide the space, we create an environment where young people can use music to build their own community), drove across the country to my hometown on the Monday, changed into a suit in my car and walked into the council offices with a freshly-stapled business plan.\r\n\r\nThey said yes, but only if I can find the funding. Councils never say no to funding.\r\n\r\nI could write a book on the next part, but you'll have to settle for a summary. In one month I raise \u00a325,000. Twenty per cent becomes a part-time wage. I order \u00a322,000 worth in equipment, but negotiate it down to less than \u00a317,000. We install a very competent recording studio with a rehearsal space, and let these ingredients simmer to see what happens.\r\n\r\nFor many young people, it was transformative. I'm reading through the old case studies now, and I'm fondly reminded of calls from teachers seeing improvements in class, or the mother whose daughter just seemed happier at home. Words like 'confidence' and 'ability' keep appearing, and I'm struck again at the story of the boy with Aspergers who wouldn't sing until his third week. These examples only skim the surface, but it was significant for all of those involved.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, I left the studio in their capable hands. The teenagers it was built for had taken charge of their own ship, and I had achieved my life's first serious ambition. My next was to become a journalist.\r\n\r\nI'm telling this story for a simple reason. I think it could be replicated in hundreds (maybe thousands) of towns around the world.\r\n\r\nAll that fundraising, studio engineering and management was hard work, but you're already connected to an internet which can guide you. Hell, I could recommend a tonne of books that would tell you everything you need to know. They worked for me.\r\n\r\nDo you know someone with enough drive to make it happen too?\r\n\r\nIs it you?\r\n\r\nIf so, send me an email. I still have all the business plans and equipment lists, and could throw in a bunch more tips to avoid certain pitfalls.\r\n\r\nMaybe some of you will take it on, and maybe culture will be a little richer for it. Who knows.\r\n\r\nAs for me? I'm working from home and enjoying family life in the English countryside. I've learnt that you can do anything if you plan it right and work hard. You can talk and talk, but nothing happens until you get up and do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Davenport\r\nplaymusic@me.com\r\nWiltshire, England\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "Hi Listservians! This is a shorter version of something I wrote in April, which can be found if you search the title.\r\n\r\nThe Loneliness of Extraversion\r\n On a recent Sunday morning, I slept until my eyes were ready to open, rearranged my apartment, ate cake for breakfast, and read online news in total silence. I did two loads of dishes, returned library books, and watched bike polo in the park. I then found my favourite tree and sat under it to think about how amazing the previous few weeks had been.\r\nI hadn\u2019t had a day without social interaction in more than two weeks, but Sunday, when I finally had some time to myself, I found that I would keep looking at my phone and try to decide whether to text or call or email or chat or bbm or \u2018like\u2019 activity or comment or message people. Amidst the solitude I had been seeking I still sought out the technological company of my peers. Sharing these experiences with people is what fuels my life, but the problem with being an extrovert, and a busy, well-liked one at that (cry me a river, I know), is that in the moments when you\u2019re not surrounded by love and friendship, you feel very much alone.\r\n\r\nEmpty spaces seem bigger. The quiet seems quieter.\r\n\r\nEventually, after resisting the thumbscializing cycle of Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and G-chat, I succumbed to the compulsion of checking what was making that red light blink, and I responded to a few of the alerts adorning my status bar. Though I don\u2019t regret doing so, I am glad I was able to hold off on them until I had appreciated my surroundings. These lonely moments are necessary, particularly to an extrovert. We function by way of external stimulation, but if we don\u2019t give ourselves the time to wipe the slate clean, we\u2019ll just be trying to catch up with the alerts of the stimuli that just happened an hour ago, a minute ago, a second ago\u2026\r\n\r\nExtroverts! We need some time off! We need to trust ourselves that whatever activity we choose for the hour, afternoon, or even whole day, will be the BEST one. During the times when we turn our phones to silent or better still, leave them at home, we will be significantly more capable of being the best participators in activities, because we give ourselves to them fully.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee-Anne Bigwood\r\nlittlebiteswithbig@gmail.com\r\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "Okke", 
        "It is a happy coincidence that I got the invite to write something to you all in my favorite week of the year. It is the week prior to a festival I help organize: FarmFest. Let me tell you why I love this festival so much.\r\n\r\nI grew up on a dairy farm in Friesland, the Netherlands. Throughout our\u00a0upbringing, my twin brother and I spent a lot of time together - building tree houses, doing chores on the farm, playing games. Both my brother and I went to study: he moved to Utrecht, while I moved to Amsterdam. I am currently finishing my Masters, and he decided move back after his BSc. He's going to continue the farm when my parents quit.\r\n\r\nMost friendships from back home have watered down through time. I only see my twin brother when I go back to visit the farm, and many other friends I only see on special occasions. Fortunately, there is something that brings a group of us together every year: FarmFest.\u00a0\r\n\r\n10 years ago a couple of friends and I decided to celebrate our birthdays together. We got some bands, lots of beers, and invited friends. Saturday July 14th we will throw the tenth of these gatherings, which we named FarmFest. This festival has grown from a few dozen friends to more than 500 people, who come to listen to bands, bbq, drink beers, dance, and relax around bonfires. Every year we improve something: better audio, a larger tent, a second stage, more bands.\r\n\r\nYet, the most pleasure I get from FarmFest is not the party itself, but the preparation. In the months and weeks before FarmFest my old friends, twin brother and I get together and try and figure out how to organise a festival. And let me assure you: creating a festival with friends is the awesomest thing in my life.\u00a0Because of the festival, I get together with my old friends and we renew our friendships by working together.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat brings your friends together?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nOkke\r\nokke@farmfest.nl\r\nScherpenzeel, Friesland, the Netherlands\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "[The Listserve] Intelligence & How to Get It", 
        "Dr Mark Evans", 
        "You are what you know.\r\n\r\nA contemporary view of intelligence finds that it is the sum of two factors:\r\n\r\nG(f) is fluid intelligence- the size of your working memory, how \u2018fast you think\u2019 etc.\r\n\r\nG(c) is concrete intelligence- a measure of how much factual information you have acquired.\r\n\r\nLearning more information then is the key to greater intelligence.\r\n\r\nHart and Risley (1995) found that children in non-working households heard, on average, 616 words per hour, while children from professional families heard 2153. By the age of three this totaled a difference of 30 million words. Less well off children are exposed to fewer concepts- and develop less concrete intelligence.\r\n\r\nResearch into memory and cognitive neuroscience has soundly shown that the learning of new material is much more efficient if you already know a body of linked material.\r\n\r\nEric Hanushek\u2019s work suggests that a good teacher can get 1.5 years of learning growth in one year, a bad teacher 0.5. The consequences of a bad teacher for a number of years in a row can be devastating. Note that many of our most challenging schools struggle to attract good teachers.\r\n\r\nFinally, we know which classroom practices most enhance learning and achievement. We have a well-developed science of learning- but you\u2019ll have to look very hard to find proof of this in our schools. It\u2019s long overdue that schools, classrooms and teachers applied what works, and the folk pedagogy and traditions that guide our educational institutions were replaced by evidence-driven practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Mark Evans\r\nmark@teachit.so\r\nNorwich, UK\r\n\r\n",

        "I find I have a few things I often admonish people about, and I\u2019ve picked one to share with you all. First, a little about myself: I am an American guy in my lower twenties. I live in the center of the state of Pennsylvania, and, on the weekends, run a small take-out BBQ. This particular job involves lots of prep work and any needed welding and fabrication to keep things in good shape. Now, as stated before, my intention is to lecture the world about something. This isn\u2019t something terribly life changing, but if you eat meat, you should know this. Use a meat thermometer! People regularly ask me questions about cooking, and when they do I usually ask them a few questions myself. One thing I find is that most people rely on some primal instinct to determine whether their meal is ready. The usual outcome is that otherwise delicious cuts of meat get overdone. There is an easier way. For about $10 you can have a tool that will tell you exactly when your food is done, every time. No more relying on some formula or a pop-out button to determine if that turkey is done, folks. Stick a thermometer in there! If the center is up to 170\u00ba, it\u2019s done, otherwise, it\u2019s not. No poking, prodding, test cuts, or other guesswork. A thermometer is certainly the cook\u2019s best friend. (Tip: don\u2019t cut that turkey right away. Cover and let cool for 10-15 minutes)\r\n\r\n\r\nJustin Smith\r\njustin@mennonitegeek.com\r\nPennsylvania\r\n\r\n",

        "I like to ask people what the last thing that really made them laugh was. I think you know a lot about someone when you know what they find the funniest. When you make somebody laugh a lot, you have complete control over them. It's an interesting power trip to know that you've reduced somebody to a blubbering mess. So tell me, when was the last time you really, really laughed? Mine was when this happened:\r\n\r\nLast year our cat Piffon died. He was a big part of the family, although it was a love/hate relationship - he had the most annoying meow you could imagine, a whiny guttural sound, like a scarred infant crying for help or something. And he was a total coward too, not one of those cool cats you hear about who kill mice. Once we actually saw him getting chased by a bird. Anyway, he was getting very old so my mum and sister took him to the vet, who explained that he had lived a long life and it was best for him to be put down. My family, despite their sadness, agreed that it was best. On the way home, my sister had Piffon's body on her lap in the car, her and mum both crying as they drove. Then suddenly, his dead body urinated profusely all over her!\r\n\r\nTears of grief turned to tears of laughter - it was Piffon's final revenge against the family who so lovingly despised him. \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nRobbie Smith \r\nbraceletofdoom@hotmail.com\r\nMurrumbeena, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\r\n\r\n",

        "Hi everyone! First I would like to say that English is not my native language, so forgive my possible (and probable) mistakes!   This letter below I wrote when I was 16 years-old and was going through a difficult phase of my life, and I thought that leaving this world was the only option. I have never showed this letter to anyone, and it was the first thing that came up in my mind when I was invited to write here. Fortunately, I don\u2019t feel like this anymore and I now I want to live my life and work it out no matter how difficult it gets. There\u2019s always a way out! : )\r\n\r\nPlease, stop worrying about whose fault was it. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but mine. I did it by my own free will, because I couldn\u2019t live with myself anymore. I couldn\u2019t stand the futility of people and their superficial  relationships, and above all, I couldn\u2019t stand and comprehend my inexplicable desire to be like them.\r\nSome say that suicides are the bravest cowards that ever existed.  I disagree. If I\u2019ve had a little bit of courage, I would have said \u201cno\u201d in many times I said \u201dyes\u201d without meaning to.\r\nI would have said more about how I really felt and less about what other people expected to hear from me. I would have stood up for my  opinions and done what I wanted to do even if the world and the people around me didn\u2019t  think it was right.\r\nI would have enjoyed things more when I had the chance, and complained less when it was no longer worthy.\r\nI would have accepted me for who I was, and I would had struggled less battles with myself. Because this last one I lost. I lost because maybe I hadn\u2019t learned how to fight it right, or because I didn\u2019t want to fight knowing I would lose it anyway.\r\nActually I think I would have lost  much more if I had continued living the life I was living. The life that was mine and, like everything else that was a part of me, I hated with all my heart.\r\nI hope you understand that this was the toughest and selfish decision I have ever had to make.  I\u2019m not gonna tell you not to be sad or angry, or cry. I just want that the only people who do it are the ones that really cared when I was alive. If my life wasn\u2019t worth it, please make sure that my death is. I want to thank those who loved me, no matter how: be still because none of you could have stopped me if you tried. I\u2019m in peace now.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenise\r\nmarionhpk@live.com\r\nSao Paulo, Brazil\r\n\r\n",

They could have easily ignored me and dismissed me as a \"little kid,\" but instead, they took me under their wing and gave me work experience, guidance, and time that I will always value.\r\n\r\nThank you to the editor of the Town Journal in Ridgewood, NJ.  At 14, I sent you my book report on the Odyssey as well as suggested that I become the paper's next book reviewer.  You didn't laugh, but invited me into your office for a meeting, where you offered me the position.  I was elated.  You worked with me through awful draft after awful draft peppered with nonsensical words from the thesaurus because I thought they sounded fancy (and New York Times-esque).  You sent me long e-mails full of suggestions about how to improve my writing, and I took each one to heart.  I can't thank you enough for taking the time to work with me and allowing me to pursue what I thought was merely a dream.\r\n\r\nThank you to Kate Jackson of HarperCollins Publishers.  After I wrote an article in the Town Journal about my disdain for teen books, she wrote an editorial in response.  I then asked if we could meet and discuss our differing opinions on teen literature, and she agreed.  When we met, she offered me a summer internship at the company in the children's editorial department.  Kate and the team I worked with that summer were incredible, and it made me realize that writing will always be a part of my life.\r\n\r\nMy point here is that if you're young, don't be afraid to do what you love.  I used to think that I had to be of a certain age to accomplish certain things, but I don't think that way any longer.  Age isn't a barrier to accomplishments, and it doesn't define who you are.  Always strive to achieve, no matter how old you are. \r\n\r\n\r\nJulia Lynch\r\njulia.lynch@nyu.edu\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n",

        "A few days ago, there was a little snafu where my subject line was attached to another e-mail. So here's the real In the Defense of Cheese.\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, there would be times that my mother's \u201cintensity\u201d would drive me to leave my home for a few days, just to get away from her. Every time that I left home like this, I would always do something different. One time I took a bus tour across the state, and another I merely spent the week at a friend's house. In one particular instance, I packed up my scouting gear and took off into the wilds of the Appalachians. After about 2 days of hiking, I came across a cabin in the woods. I had enough food packed and I really didn't mind sleeping in a tent, so when I knocked upon the door, it was curiosity that drove me. An elderly hermit named Mary Ykatherine then came to the door (it's a silent \u201cY\u201d apparently). She treated me to what I thought was borscht, but what was apparently 85% peyote. I closed my eyes for a second after the meal, and when I opened them Mary Ykatherine was gone, and in her place was a gorgeous princess. I inquired as to who she was and she said, \u201cIn the defense of cheese... THAT WAS DELICIOUS!\u201d I don't remember much more from that trip.\r\n\r\n\r\nBen\t\r\nMiloTC@aol.com\r\nColumbia, SC, USA\r\n\r\n",

Not expected to last the year, the publishers using the hatch/match/despatch model (HATCH: create a new comic title and an excited audience looking for issue #1. MATCH: Merge a successful title with a less successful title, joining the audience together - usually heralded with the phrase \"EXCITING NEWS CHUMS!\" and, finally, DESPATCH: Shut down publication of the lesser title, saving money)\r\n\r\nIssue 2 of 2000AD featured the introduction of the character \"Judge Dredd\". Designed as an anti hero, Dredd, unintionally, turned out to have a vast appeal to the kids who read it.\r\n\r\nI was one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 14 years old I loved comics and computers but, comics were derided and computers looked like it could lead to a day job (in fact, I started working in computers at 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2000, when I turned 30 and 2000AD, unbelievably still in print, was finally catching up with itself, having realised that all I ever wanted to do with my life was to draw comics, I pushed.\r\n\r\nOne year later I was drawing Judge Dredd.\r\n\r\nI've now been drawing comics, and Judge Dredd as a professional comic artist for over a decade.

        "Ten years ago, I ate 3.5 grams of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms for a simple, silly reason: I wanted to see things move. I have always been a textual person, a writer, and I wanted to unlock my visual imagination. What I experienced that sweet December night profoundly transformed the way I move through reality and engage with my fellow human beings. The visuals had very little to do with it.\r\n\r\nWhile other elements of my late teenage life had edged open a door from the lonely, angry place I often found myself, it was that first dose of psilocybin that helped me step through. It is entirely possible that I would have eventually arrived at this place of joy and compassion without psychedelics, but the point is moot. They have been powerful allies along the path.\r\n\r\nI harbor no illusion that psychedelics are a good idea for everyone. For many people, they may in fact be a very bad idea. They certainly won\u2019t save the world. But they do have the capacity, when used safely and responsibly in an informed context, to better individual lives.\r\n\r\nAs non-profit organizations like MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) and the Heffter Institute increasingly receive federal approval for clinical trials into the therapeutic benefits these drugs can offer, and as psychedelics re-enter the mainstream consciousness of culture at large, I hope that the people whose lives they touch decide to work towards the betterment of society instead of dropping out of it.

Most children will be assaulted by a relative or family friend, most women by an acquaintance. Teach your children to know a dangerous situation, rather than relying on \u201cstranger danger\u201d. Women should know that they are not necessarily safe when they are with people they know.\r\n\r\nConversely, enjoy the company of people around you. Do not approach everyone like they are a potential scam artist/thief/rapist/liar. Life is too short to view everyone as a suspect.\r\n\r\nIf someone has a weapon and says \u201cCome with me or I\u2019ll hurt you\u201d, DO NOT GO! Where you are is much safer than whatever abandoned place you are about to be brought to, that\u2019s why they want you to leave it. Throw a loud fit and run towards people as if your life depended on it (it might). Even if you are injured, you are in a populated place and will receive medical attention. Many people have been murdered and/or sexually assaulted by simply following instructions.\r\n\r\nLove is a risk, but worth it. After exiting a marriage with someone who was such a compulsive liar that he was effectively a stranger, I thought I\u2019d never take that risk again. However, after time (and therapy), I am lucky enough to find myself less than a month away from marrying the best partner I could possibly imagine.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a country that celebrates Halloween, let your children celebrate it as you did when you were young: scared and in the dark. \u201cSafe\u201d events aren\u2019t the point of Halloween, and it isn\u2019t fun for kids.\r\n\r\nWith much luck, health, and happiness,\r\n\r\n\r\nMeghan Callahan\r\nmabnon@gmail.com\r\nDuluth, Minnesota, USA\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After this trek I will have hiked around 200 miles during my time there. Having grown up in New York, spending a few weeks in the mountains of New Mexico opened my eyes. First of all, I had no idea that scrawny 15 year old me could carry all of that gear over 60+ miles. The trip also gave me my first 'raw' view of nature; from mountains in the sunrise to a deer that had been mauled by a mountain lion. The first night sky I saw revealed a blanket of stars that are hidden in New York City. Finally comprehending the sheer vastness of it humbled me. Unfortunately a few months later I received the news that my neighbor, a fire-fighter, had perished on September 11th. I was devastated for quite some time after that. While it has never been easy to deal with, it certainly shaped who I am today.\r\n\r\nI feel like I'm lucky to have had that \"Oh... the universe can be dumb and sometimes I can't control everything\" moment so early.

They build and maintain servers and networks that people in their company use to do their job. That means, the default state of this infrastructure is that it has to work. Nearly every single phone call is about what is not working and that it should be fixed immediately. To manage this structure is a lot of work and if they do a good job, the phone won\u2019t ring. I literally see my colleagues tense up and sigh whenever the phone rings.\r\n\r\nThis means that doing a good job is measured by the amount of phone calls they are not getting. If you consider that people who are drawn into I.T. tend to be introverted and shy, having their only contact from people of other departments consisting of complaints puts a real stress on their psyche. You may think that nerds are sarcastic, condescending or just not listening to you.

I never had a choice.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had my time thanking the Universe. I\u2019ve also had time blaming it on the Cosmic Irony.

        "Do you want to feel free? Do you want to take control over your destiny ?  My modest contribution will discuss how I got there by being an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nMany of my friends and family have warned me, telling me it was very risky to be an entrepreneur, because I could fail, lose a lot of time and money. Telling me that it was much better to remain an employee, to be protected by the salary and social protection.\r\n\r\nFinally, I did not listen and I created my own business  In the mean time, I realized that many people around me were dismissed because of the crisis while I still have my job, my company and I managed to keep my team. So being an employee could be risky as well, especially for aged people.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy but I am convinced that somehow I'll be able to do great things.  Above all, I am no longer dependent on others, I no longer need to find a company that suits me, nor a position where I am happy. I no longer need to communicate the relevance of my ideas, I just follow my intuition, think and act.\r\n\r\nThe future only depends on me, the energy that I put in what I do, my choices, the opportunities that I take, the mistakes I make and finally my ability to turn the luck into success.   Now I feel free, happy and master of my fate. And I think it will last forever\r\n\r\n\r\nMarc Thouvenin \r\nrsp@thouvenin.fr \r\nFrance\r\n\r\n",

        "Hello friend distant or near,\r\n\r\nLet me share a part of my life with you. Exactly two years ago I started my current job. At a hostel chain in the Netherlands where - after being in social welfare for nearly a year - I was so happy to fine a full-time position. Which meant I would have (more) money, and would be able to leave my parents place again. To which I was more or less forced due to a lack of financial means at age 28\u2026after having lived by myself the previous 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe last two years have passed swiftly. I have paid off all my student debts; poring nearly 1000 EUR in your debt the day your salary arrives feels awkward I can tell you that. (small note: fuck this debt-ridden consumptionism society). At work I have revamped almost the complete web infrastructure. Money is being made, and everybody is happy. But I'll leave my job end of August. I see question marks on the faces of all my colleagues: why leave before reaping what you saw? There is crisis out there!? It is time to move on.\r\n\r\nTo what, to where? I don't know. Having arrived at age 30 I thought the road to take would somehow be easier, contours would be more crisp. The exact opposite is the case\u2026 I don't have a clue, I'm totally fucking lost.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I might have some hard and/or confusing months ahead, but I think I'm ready for it. I've come full circle, and it's time for something new. I take comfort in the phrase I've just read on George profile (last night's couchsurfer):\r\n\r\n> If you don't know where you're going, then you'll never get lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nGodspeed,\r\nPatrick Beeker\r\npatrick.beeker@gmail.com\r\n@pbeeker\r\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "[The Listserve] Combining hobbies to reach creative heights", 
        "Ramon van Dam", 
        "Hello all,\r\n\r\nAll my life I have been fascinated by two things; movies and computers. I am currently 25 years old and am happy to say I have been able to include these two interesting topics into my daily life on a regular basis. Not only am I active as a software consultant, in my spare time I am also applying what I pick up at my job to my own interactive website about movies.\r\n\r\nI have to say it feels really great to be able to combine two of my greatest hobbies in this manner, and I can recommend anyone to try to accomplish the same. Luckily it doesn't happen often, but when I'm for example not interested in programming for a while I can still work on the data for the website. Vice versa, I can optimize some underlying code when I don't feel like updating the list of upcoming movies or something similar.\r\n\r\nI have been working on this project for almost a decade, although I only shared it with the world two years ago. Working on something for that long not only provides a steady basis to come back to regularly, it also allows me to try out different creative concepts. Whenever I discover an interesting new technique or idea, I can immediately apply it to this project that is always in my mind somewhere.\r\n\r\nI can imagine some people experiencing such a long running project as limiting, but for me it works quite the opposite way. There is no golden rule that applies to everyone, but I do recommend to try and find several topics of interest to combine in a creative way. Perhaps you'll find something new and exciting to come back to now every now and then, who knows!\r\n\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nRamon van Dam \r\nramon@filmcentrum.nl \r\nSchaijk, the Netherlands\r\n\r\n",

(Other than a basketball hoop from Sprite, which was actually pretty exciting).\r\n\r\nI've had a hard time figuring out what to write, as my mind has been utterly consumed with the study of medicine lately. With that being said, I've decided to just stick to what I know best right now.\r\n\r\nI'm therefore going to use my one chance to speak to 21k+ people to urge you to heavily consider quitting smoking, if that's something you do. I've held the lungs of a [dead] smoker, and have operated on smokers, and the effects of tobacco on the body are not pretty. We all know the dangers and how tobacco destroys the living tissues in our body.\r\n\r\nUnderstand this: quitting will not be easy. It won't happen right away. Talk with your health care provider to learn your options. Get support from friends and family who understand the battle that you'll be undertaking.\r\n\r\nReasons to quit:\r\n\r\n-your risk of a heart attack halves after the first year\r\n\r\n-your risk of cancer decreases by 50% after five years\r\n\r\n-after 15 years, your risk of a heart attack/stroke is equal to a non-smoker's\r\n\r\n-it's ~$200/month back in your pocket (enough to fund a decent vacation!)\r\n\r\n-your teeth will be whiter\r\n\r\n-food will taste better\r\n\r\n-you and your possessions will smell nicer\r\n\r\n-sex will be better\r\n\r\nI encourage ALL my patients, including the 90 y/os, to quit smoking, as it's that beneficial.

I think it\u2019s the possibility of transcendence - that none of us really know what we can achieve when pushed but that, in sport, sometimes we get to find out.\r\n\r\nThe Olympics has been a great opportunity to see this in action. Ten million people here in the UK watched Chris Hoy\u2019s final race and all of us thought he\u2019d lost his lead - and the race - coming into the final bank. But then, in what seemed an impossible moment of strength, he found something and pulled ahead to take the gold. In interviews, he clearly had no idea how he\u2019d done it either. You could see it too in the utter surprise on Kat Copeland\u2019s face when she and Sophie Hosking won gold or in Manteo Mitchell, finishing his part in a relay on a broken leg because he didn\u2019t want to let his team down!\r\n\r\nMy own sporting achievements are rather more limited of course, but after a decade of inactivity I\u2019ve now become a pretty committed cyclist, regular swinger of kettlebells and occasional runner. I\u2019m the fittest I\u2019ve ever been and have lost a shockingly large amount of weight. And the best thing is, I\u2019ve no idea what my body is really capable of, or just how far (and how fast!) I can go. But watching the world\u2019s athletes giving their all and exceeding even the massive expectations placed on their shoulders makes me wonder if it\u2019s further than ever seemed possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Clarke\r\nhello@psclarke.co.uk\r\nNottingham, UK\r\n\r\n",

        "Dear Listservers,\r\n\r\nI'm still figuring out how a lot of stuff works in life. I like to think that I get it right most of the times, but of course I fuck up a lot too.\r\n\r\nI believe that's what it means to be human.\r\n\r\nHere are some random tips/insights I've had that will hopefully improve your life or either give you something to think about, they did for me.\r\n\r\n1) A clean house is one of the best things, but sometimes seems an impossible task. Just set out to de-clutter a little bit each day. I started by making my bed every morning, it only takes 5 minutes, but drastically improves the room. A mini-challenge: I'd like you to stop whatever you're doing right now, and clear off the nearest surface (be it a kitchencounter or desk) for the next 15 minutes\u2026 Go!\r\n\r\n2) When people do shitty things and you call them out on their behavior, it's OK when it feels uncomfortable. The boundary you set makes them experience negative emotions and that is allright.\r\n- Likewise, if someone calls you out on your behavior, own your negative emotions. Apologize and allow yourself to feel shitty. No-one is a pro on how to interact with everyone. Rule of thumb: Don't do to others what you wouldn't like happening to yourself.\r\n\r\n3) Love the people you love. Let them know that you care about them. Make it a point to let someone know today. And when you do someone a favor, don't expect anything in return, that's what favors are.  Olympia, WA, USA\r\n\r\n\r\nNicoline\r\nnicoline.listserve@gmail.com\r\nNetherlands\r\n\r\n",

As friends are known to do, they egged me on until we decided that, as a group, that we would run a 5K together. I started the Couch to 5K program the next day and 9 weeks later was able to run the 5K faster than my friends, some of whom were experienced runners.\r\n\r\nHaving been able to do 3.1 miles, I was bitten by the bug. I began the Couch to 10K program, and then sought out other training programs online. The first weekend of January 2011, I was able to run my first half marathon. With 13.1 miles completed, there was only one other goal left to achieve. Ten months later, I was able to run the ING NYC Marathon with American Cancer Society's Team Determination.

If we multiply them and add one, we get a new number, let's call it x. x can either be prime or not. If x is prime we have found a number, which is not in our prime number set, which was therefore not complete. If x is not prime, there is a number y, which divides x. But y isn't in our prime number set, because no number in this set can divide x. So also in this case the set wasn't complete. Since we can do this for any finite number of primes, there has to be an infinite number of them ... TADA!

I'm a older than most of the people working on the project, some times a LOT older (I'm over 49!), but that doesn't really bother me (hopefully it doesn't bother anyone else!). I love how the internet has allowed all of us involved to find each other and share our ideas and make this project happen. I hope this is the first of many.

The Universe and the airlines have conspired to make my thoughts a reality. One suitcase. 50 pounds. And a lot of soul searching.  More than 60 years of collecting has turned into 3 months of giving away and donating everything that will not fit into the suitcase. I believe I have been given an opportunity to live my dream, and with that, a chance to get clear about what is really important in this all too brief life. With that in mind: it is our relationships, not our \"stuff\" that is truly important. The ones you love will live forever in your mind and heart. Life is short, but we can cause our experience of it to be deep and wide. There is no distance too great for thoughts to travel. Dreams come true.

The silence was broken on the tee box of the 16th hole, a 180 yard par 3, while waiting for a group of ladies to finish up on the green. Haas said to me, \"So Brian what are you studying in college?\" as he swung his golf club lazily against the short grass. I replied, \"Computer Science.\" Then Haas asked, \"What do you want to do with your degree in Computer Science?\" I answered, \"I'm not really sure, but I know I want to be independently wealthy so I can play golf like you guys.\" Mr. Rappaport's ears perked, he turned, pulled the cigar from his mouth, and interjected, \"If you want to be successful it's very simple: All you have to do is work as hard as everyone else, and then work harder.\"  And I stood there in silence for he taught me as one having authority, and not as the scribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian Donohue\r\nbrian@echocheckin.com\r\nBrooklyn, NY\r\n\r\n",

I've felt more awake, my posture and body control have improved dramatically, and most of all I've been having tons of fun. But the story doesn't end there.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, my heart is broken. Literally. I have a genetic disease that deforms the heart over time, causing it to pump less efficiently, so every physical activity is more demanding. Every time I overexert myself I risk permanent damage to my heart, making the condition worse. I've known this for a while now, but I had been ignoring it and pushing myself to the limit nonetheless, just because I couldn't deal with the idea of reverting to my old unfit self. I'm slowly learning to accept my limitations, however, no matter how unfair they feel, and am trying to find a middle way that keeps me fit and protects my heart at the same time.\r\n\r\nI want you guys to take a minute today to appreciate the wonder of this incredibly complex and fragile machinery we inhabit, which keeps ticking along day in and day out, without us even noticing until something goes wrong. Maybe take another minute and ask yourselves if you are putting enough effort into maintaining it, considering you'll be stuck inside for the next 20, 50, 80 years. And if you have a suggestion for an awesome, low-intensity sport that's engaging and fun, I would absolutely love to hear it!\r\n\r\n\r\nVitor Bosshard\r\nalgorias@yahoo.com\r\nZ\u00fcrich, Switzerland\r\n\r\n",

Why subscribe? Won't I hear about the amazing truth bomb in another corner of the internet?\r\n\r\n-Is turnover high? People coming on for a week, then leaving. Does that matter?\r\n\r\n-How is the listserve going to grow? It seems stuck.\r\n\r\n-Usually, listserves serve a specific community of interest. What\u2019s our common denominator? What similar themes have you seen in the emails?\r\n\r\n-Also, usually, a listserve becomes a conversation. People reply, and we see the replies- good and crazy. There isn't really a conversation here. Does that matter?\r\n\r\nEnough questions. All- I enjoy your random emails; life is weird and often sad.

Speeding along the highway, I looked across the Rio Grande and into Mexico.  It's nothing but a river that draws the line between these two countries, but that river's arbitrary contours divide wealth from poverty, safety from violence. It's just a river, but there's no question on which side you'd rather exist.\r\n\r\nIsn't that dumb?  \r\n\r\nI'm baffled by how much things over which we have no control shape our lives.  Race, gender, national origin-- these characteristics are all determined by the roll of some metaphysical die before birth, and yet drastically affect our life experience.  For me, being white meant the border patrol agents in Arizona didn't harass me. However, being a woman meant my heartbeat quickened when I walked past a group of men in an isolated part of Seattle.  \r\n\r\nWe're all assholes because we each possess certain unearned privileges that others don't, and probably don't reckon with that thought enough.  I highly recommend reading \"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\" by Peggy McIntosh and \"The Male Privilege Checklist\" by Barry Deutsch, if you haven't. \r\n\r\nIf despair sets in, give a listen to the most beautiful song I've ever heard: \"Two Doves\" by Dirty Projectors.

I could go on about actual scientific studies that link music to a whole host of physical and psychological benefits, but rather than rattle on here, try it.\r\n\r\nA musician myself, I\u2019ve played the piano for about half my life. I don\u2019t profess to be any good, in fact I\u2019d say I\u2019m rather rubbish (though my friends & fans would likely say otherwise). In the beginning, I would do everything by rote. Always playing from sheet music, never improvising, and not truly understanding the underlying logic of what I was playing. It was not until I shipped off to college sans my mammoth sheet music collection that I first forced myself to try to play from memory \u2013 I recall repeatedly enthusing myself with the crashing  I-V-IV progression of The Who\u2019s Baba O\u2019Riley and feeling better than I ever did playing Chopin.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve since found that by simply listening to music on a regular basis, I\u2019ve become a better musician, and my life has improved too. I started writing my own tunes, and running regularly listening to music, getting into the best shape of my life. I put together a band called The Medicine (music is medicine, after all) and have a whole bunch of material that you can find under my own name (or username brtnlewis) on SoundCloud.

Think of the millions of cars\u00a0idling\u00a0right now at an annoying stoplight for now good reason contributing to global warming.\r\n2. Bananas should be sold in bunches of varying ripeness. That way all your bananas don't go bad at the same time and everyday you have another perfectly ripe banana.\r\n3. A TV show like\u00a0Extreme\u00a0Makeover but for helping people get out of debt. Shows how terrible people are at money management skills and then helps them with budgeting, saving, etc.\r\n4.\u00a0Moistened toilet paper that is flushable, like the wipes parents use to change diapers. More sanitary, antibacterial, fresh smelling.\r\n5. Babysitting rooms at movie theaters. Gyms have them, why not movie theaters?\r\n6. Gear share program at vacation destinations. It sucks renting umbrellas and stuff when you go to the beach. Other\u00a0vacationers\u00a0who are leaving when you're arriving can hand off the stuff they used.\r\n7. Washers and dryers should be combined. I think these exists but why aren't they the norm? Moving your wet clothes from the washer to the nearly identical looking dryer is stupid. I'm sure one machine could do both.\r\n8. Bike-In restaurants.\r\n9. All movie trailers should end with a form that allows you to submit your info and address so you are alerted when the movie comes to your local theater or becomes\u00a0available\u00a0to buy.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nZach Olsen\r\nzach@minimalisttees.com\r\nBoulder, CO\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "So, if you're already familiar with ALS, feel free to skip to the next paragraph. Take a moment and imagine what it would be like to be a prisoner in your body. You are unable to move, communicate, or even breathe on your own. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal column that control all of your body's voluntary muscle movements. Little by little, as these muscles weaken and die, you lose control of your body. Your cognitive abilities remain intact, and so the disease effectively traps you inside your own body until the end of your life. ALS is currently incurable.\r\n\r\nA little over 2 years ago, my uncle lost his battle with ALS. The heartache it has brought to my father, my aunt and my cousins is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Since his passing, many members of our family have become active in the fight against ALS, which brings me to my heartfelt plea:\r\n\r\nOn October 21st I'll be participating in the ALS Association's Walk to Defeat ALS at the Los Angeles Coliseum. I'd like to invite everyone in the LA/Southern California area to walk with me! You can e-mail me for details about joining my team, let's harness the incredible power of this group to make a difference in the world! If you can't walk, please consider making a donation to ALS research. Together we can find a cure.\r\n\r\nxox,\r\nBecca\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nBecca Dorman\r\nbecca.dorman@gmail.com\r\nLos Angeles, CA\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "Hi Listserve\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat\u2019s up? I love hearing your stories, you know. I hope I\u2019ll be as entertaining as you have been.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFirst some words about me:\r\nI\u2019m a 30 years old/young guy & have an amazing girlfriend, who luckily also has become my wife since January of this year!\r\nWhen I say married, I mean a civil marriage, not a religious marriage. To be honest, I don\u2019t really understand why some people have a need to believe in something imaginative. In history, religion only has given us wars, disputes,try to control & influence their followers, .... Don\u2019t start about all the values it gives us. ;-) Those are just human values that some religions have considered their\u2019s, but in fact they are not. These values are culturally dependent human values. Nothing to do with religion if you\u2019d ask me. You know... the world would be such a better place when people stopped believing in those religions and started believing in themselves, their friends & their neighbours. What a fun world it would be!\r\nShe is also pregnant. My wife I mean, not the religion ;-) It\u2019ll be our first child, so it\u2019s kind of spooky, fun, scary & really cool; All at the same time :-)I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\r\nI\u2019m currently working as a marketeer for Coca-Cola & am \u00a0living in the centre of the world (?!?): Belgium.\r\nFor those who don\u2019t know Belgium, it is: Brussels / HQ of NATO & EU / Belgian fries (no they should not be called french fries!) / Belgian beers / Kim Clijsters / ...\r\nBy now, you probably know where Belgium is situated. ;-)\r\n\u00a0\r\nBelgium is a tiny country, but it is awesome. I love living here. I do admit that sometimes people complain too much, but I guess that is the same everywhere ;-)\r\nEven though it is a fun country, I\u2019m hoping to move, in a couple of years, to Sydney, Australia or Atlanta, USA. I already have lived in France & the UK and I love integrating in new cultures & getting to know them. Does anybody live in Atlanta & Sydney? Don\u2019t hesitate to give your views about these cities!\r\n\u00a0\r\nI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t believe me, but in 2 days I\u2019m leaving on a holiday which is aweseome. Yeaeaeaeaeaeaeaaah!!!\r\nI\u2019m going on a 3-week roadtrip with as an endgoal Tuscany/Umbria in Italy.I love travelling so much. Usually I only decide during the travelling where I\u2019m going, where I\u2019ll sleep, etc.\r\nIs somebody living there? Or has some good tips to visit there? Or where to sleep? Or what to do? I\u2019d love to get some out of the box ideas :-)\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut now, let\u2019s get serious. What is it actually that I\u2019d like to tell to you guys/girls:\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only do those things you love doing!

He believed that education is a public good - that it should be available to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay, gender, race, religion, social class, or political beliefs.  This may not seem like a huge thing now, but it was then.\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring it up now is because the institution he founded, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, is in trouble.  It has been a full-scholarship college for art, architecture, and engineering students since 1902 but it will run out of money in 2015 unless it gets significant help.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not soliciting donations (I doubt there are a lot of rogue billionaires on this list anyway. . .) but I would like you to take 10 seconds to Google \u201cCooper Union\u201d and learn about Peter Cooper\u2019s dream for education.

        "Dear Listserve,\r\n\r\nI am not asking my question rhetorically.  I am a doctor, and I need to know.\r\n\r\nA \u201ccode\u201d is an emergency that sends a large team of doctors, nurses, technicians and others to a patient who is unresponsive, not breathing, or pulseless.  It is a frenzy of activity.  Unless a designated representative of the patient says otherwise, the team springs into action and determines whether to begin CPR.  The process involves much more than pounding on a chest for a minute, and that by itself can be violent.  Ribs are broken, and the patient rocks from side to side from the force required.  Orders are yelled across the room.  And if the patient does not begin breathing spontaneously soon, they may put a tube down his trachea and connect him to a machine that will breathe for him.\r\n\r\nOn television, the survival rate when something like this happens is close to 50%. In reality, a patient whose heart stops has about a 15% chance of surviving to leave the hospital.  Survival does not guarantee quality of life.  There may be brain damage or other problems.  This being said, an attempt at resuscitation is appropriate for many people--and for many others, it is not.\r\n\r\nYour current state of health, age, and other factors affect your chances for a good recovery.  Depending on how things go, breathing machines, surgeries, loss of functional capacity, or rehabilitation may follow.  Think about this decision and discuss it with your family before you are hospitalized.  Ask your doctor if you need help. \"Five Wishes\" is a good place to start.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.\r\nDenver, Colorado\r\nlunarblue23@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",

All these dreams I've had for us, for me, didn't end because my marriage ended, or I couldn't finance them or find time to breathe life into them. They ended because I gave up on them; resigned myself to the fact that life was always going to be hard. So, I put my dreams on paper and figured out what I needed to do to make them happen. I wrote down what it would feel like to accomplish them. I'm not talking about buying stuff or jetting around the world. I'm talking about living!\r\n\r\nAnd yesterday, exhausted, I almost gave in and slept. Then I saw this pinned to the board above my desk: \u201cDon't give up what you LOVE most for what you WANT now.\u201d My bucket list contains one item: I want to live someplace beautiful. Everything else will fall into place from there. Taking a nap in the miserable heat won't get me there.

It was the dawn of the digital age, and while I could clearly see how computers would change everything, everything about education did not. Yet the most valuable thing I learned was how to learn and how to fail. The easiest path to failure is to take risks. Everyday I try to do different things, to take a different path, to read something on a topic I've never explored. Today I am a serial entrepreneur. I'm on my seventh start up, an idea I conceived almost six years ago, and one that is all about exploring a journey instead of settling for a destination.

        "Politicians, pundits, and religious figures say the Bible dictates how you should vote on certain issues. Unfortunately, much of it is not true.\r\n\r\nAbortion: It\u2019s not murder, and the penalty for causing a miscarriage against the will of the mother can be a simple fine (Exodus 21). Sometimes God calls for pregnant women (and the fetus) to be put to death (Genesis 38).\r\n\r\nContraception and masturbation: The Bible is silent on these issues. God killed Onan for coitus interruptus (\u201cspilling his seed\u201d), as punishment for refusing to impregnate his brother\u2019s widow (Genesis 38).\r\n\r\nHomosexuality: The Bible says all sex outside of a marriage is wrong and does not differentiate for homosexual acts. But in the same places it also prohibits eating shellfish, tattoos, divorce, wearing gold, wearing clothes made of two different cloths, and other rules absurd to modern society that the church ignores (e.g. Leviticus 11). Why aren\u2019t they protesting retailers and seafood restaurants?\r\n\r\nMarriage: While you may hear that the Bible defines marriage as \u201cone man, one woman\u201d (it doesn\u2019t), it actually has examples of \u201cone man, many women\u201d, \u201ca rapist and his victim\u201d, \u201ca soldier and prisoner of war\u201d.\r\n\r\nWealth: Jesus says it\u2019s hard for the rich to get into heaven, and people should give away all of their possessions. Not tax cuts for the rich.\r\n\r\nBible\u2019s literal truth: Our modern Bible has thousands of changes from the original texts (read any Bart Ehrman book).\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let people cynically manipulate you for their personal gain or prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nJared\t\r\ngoogoljared@gmail.com\t\r\nAtlanta, GA (USA)\r\n\r\n",

Don\u2019t forget to call yours and tell them you love \u2018em.\r\n\r\n\r\nTalia Klein\r\ntaliak91@gmail.com\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n",

        "It is interesting to me how science is largely misused, misquoted, and misunderstood by the vast majority of people around the world. We haven\u2019t even come that far in our scientific understanding of the world, yet it seems to me that we are in danger of slipping back toward the times when scientists were feared and derided for their ideas, and churches and warlords made the decisions for us all.\r\n\r\nI see it now all around: anti-vaccination movements, and anti-fluoridation movements, for example. Conspiracy theories and junk-science are beginning to over power public and private discussion. Even the very notion of intellectualism is no longer a desirable trait.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m thinking of Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist, who at one point said at that he isn\u2019t worried so much about today\u2019s children. Instead, it is the adults we need to worry about; the adults whom are afraid of the number 13, read horoscopes, and insist schools stop using Wi-Fi connections.\r\n\r\nI have three requests for everyone:\r\n\r\n    Don\u2019t believe everything you hear or read, but be willing to trust the evidence of experts.\r\n    Be willing to stand up against unfounded and unreasonable claims made by pundits, crack-pots, and the delusional.\r\n    Enjoy and embrace the idea that we, as humans, don\u2019t have all the answers, yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrendan O'Brien\r\nb.tk.obrien@gmail.com\r\nAlberta, Canada\r\n\r\n",

        "So as a recently turned 21 year old, I feel I don't know as much as almost everybody else here on the listserve. I have no wise words, no humbling story, but by no means do I live an unfulfilled life. I\u2019ve found in my short, but fun filled existence that if you want to do something then you should never let things hold you back.\r\n\r\n             I know there are certain circumstances which don\u2019t allow you to fulfil goals and objectives, but surely there\u2019s a way around them? A lot of the time we\u2019re creating our own barriers that hold us back because were too comfortable in what we know. So I challenge you, the reader to go out there and do something different, something that gets you one step further to what you want out of life, and do it with a smile on your face, because as a drunken man once said to me \u201cWhy are you young ones so angry?\u201d\r\n\r\n             Another thing I\u2019ve learnt so far is never to be jealous of others. It\u2019s the easiest way to bring yourself down. Just be comfortable with what you can, or even can\u2019t do and take solace in the fact that somebody will be jealous of you at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks for reading, Matt.\r\nmattymoomoomoo@hotmail.co.uk\t\r\nU.K\r\n\r\nP.S If anybody out there knows of any theatre comedies that aren\u2019t well known, please feel free  to send them my way, as I am very.

I have lived here all my life and its a beautiful place.\r\n3) Read. & by reading I don't mean magazines. Grab a book and turn the pages.\r\n4) Have a 'Me' day. Preferably a weekend day. Get a haircut, drink some wine, check into a hotel solo. Take care of yourself.\r\n5) Learn to cook your favorite meal(s).\r\n6) Lastly, take lots of pictures and tell the ones you love you love them as often as you can.\r\n\r\nFeel free to share some insight on your country or city.

You're made to feel like you're  two inches tall, that everything (even the things you had nothing to do with) is with) is somehow your fault. The reason for someone's action isn't always clear but treating someone horribly because you've had a bad day is just inexcusable.

You just might change your tone. \r\n\r\n-Handmade and from the heart. \r\n\r\nIn today's world everything is automated, digitized, prepackaged, almost everything is done for you.

        "Richard Mignogna, Ph.D., P.E.", 
        "Much has been written in the popular and technical press lately about the emerging electric vehicle, both pro and con.  In spite of wishful thinking, don't expect significant penetration any time this decade.  There is probably a role for EVs but it is not the widespread consumer market.  Rather, it is more likely to be various fleet applications such as delivery vehicles or limited urban transit applications.  For all but the most dedicated clean energy afficionados and hobbyists, or those who can afford a third vehicle, how many consumers can afford to pay the prices being charged for a vehicle with such limited capability?  Most cannot.  Second, there is still the issue that, in most places, the electricity used to recharge an EV will come predominantly from coal.  So, the environmental benefits, at best, are muted. But, cost and performance aside, there is another difficulty with an electric transportation infrastructure that few seem to speak about.  If you loved Big Oil, you will really love Big Monopoly Electric Utility extending its dominance to the transportation sector.  Gasoline prices have at least been shown to be sufficiently elastic that they respond to consumer demand.  And, within a limited range, consumers still have a choice of providers.  Hence, there is at least some semblance of a free market at play -- even if it is an oligopoly.  In contrast, a consumer's only choice for recharging that overpriced EV is the local monopoly utility and to pay whatever its regulator-approved rate is.  Good luck there.  So, there is a use for electro-motive transportation.  It just isn't the one everyone is talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Mignogna, Ph.D., P.E.\r\nGolden, Colorado\r\n@RichMignogna\r\n\r\n",

Jim's favorite thing to draw is big muscly guys, a subject I'm normally not very interested in- but Jim combines his knowledge of every single muscle in the human body with an astonishing sense of grace and flow; his musclemen are things of beauty.\r\n\r\nLooking closely at his drawings for an extended period of time, I despaired ever being that good. Until one day he brought in some ancient drawings from when he was a teenager. It was... not good. I looked at it, and something went *click* in my head. This art was pretty much EXACTLY as bad as the stuff I was drawing at that age. Except this drawing from 15-year-old Jim was a few years older than ME. And he'd been drawing EVER SINCE. He'd BETTER be able to draw rings around me.\r\n\r\nThat day, I quit looking at other people's artwork and thinking \"I could never draw that\". There are still things I can't draw, techniques I'm pretty useless at. But I know that if I really want to, I can spend a few years practicing, and I'll have it. I started getting a lot better after that realization.\r\n\r\nOf course, I've been lucky to have the time and finances to pursue this.

I have a love of music \u2013 not just one style but the very thought of music fills me with joy. To that end I decided to go to every concert that I came across or heard about.\r\n\r\nI went to music festivals, choral works, musical theatre and opera; to see blues and rock bands at pubs, country and western stampedes, jazz in the park, saw Leonard Cohen under the stars and cried as I heard Barber\u2019s Adagio for Strings played live for the first time.\r\n\r\nWhat did I learn? I learned to listen. Not just to music but to atmosphere, to the joy of those around me, to wonder at the incredible gestalt that can form between artist(s) and the audience and to rejoice in the ability to allow sound to fill your heart until you are sure you must glow with radiance.\r\n\r\nTo this day I still say Yes to music with three more events added over the weekend.\r\n\r\nI hope that this email may inspire you to say Yes to a new experience in your life.

Being a child, my dreams have always been, in order, of writing, being independant, travelling, and leaving the remote region where i grew up. I did that first, when i moved to Paris aged 19 to study. Then, i started a glamorous and promising commercial and marketing career in fashion that led me to live in Paris, Dubai, and Milan, and travel round the world. I have been lucky and spoiled, only to discover that it was time for me to start writing, and become independant. Few months ago, I have left a promising career to start my own business, and I am launching it next week. And guess what? It is all about writing! I am thrilled, excited, overwhelmed, and... scared to death!   Few words of wisdom from my experience so far: - take risks, challenge yourself. - everything happens for a reason. - write, every day. - people always expect more from you when you have curly hair.   Happiness is a decision. Few of my own little secrets for a happier life: - every morning, say thank you. - every day, give a compliment to someone you do not know. - speak words of love, focus on the good in people. - get rid of that guiltyness. - allow yourself some time to get lost, carried away.

Actually, seven years later, I'm still in contact with him.\r\n\r\nVery few people understand this decision. They think I should have sued him for all he's worth and destroyed his life. \"Why do you still talk to that pervert?\" they ask.\r\n\r\nMy answer is this: Because I understand what hate will do if I grab hold of it. It will lodge itself in every corner of my mind and soul and I will go through life believing I'm a victim and that things are happening TO me. I'll focus on what I don't have instead of what I do.\r\n\r\nI must instead focus on the good and the love. My stepfather wasn't abusive, verbally or physically, in any way and, in fact, he was a damn good stepfather most of the time.\r\n\r\nWe are who we are not based solely on who we decide to be in any given moment but what society, people around us, and our environment TEACH us to be. Don't jump to conclusions about others. Rather, take the time and energy to understand why they do what they do and how they got to be who they are.\r\n\r\nLook inward.

I haven't been to church since May, I'm questioning my thoughts on a lot of the Church's social doctrines, and I don't pray nearly as often as I used to.\r\n\r\nI got some bad news from home recently about a friend, and only several days later did I even think to pray. Realizing that I had forgotten that astounded me, because in other times that would have been my first instinct. Trying to pray, however, felt no better. I felt weird asking for God's help--like a friend who hasn't called you back in months but suddenly needs a place to crash. I ended up calling my mom and asking her to pray, because I feel like my prayers have by now lost whatever potency they may have ever held.\r\n\r\nIf I'm going to be a lapsed Catholic, I want it to be a product of reading and honest questioning, investigating the philosophical arguments for Catholicism, really narrowing down what I agree with. Basically, I want to have done the legwork\u2014not just have gotten lazy, which is pretty much what happened with going to church. Religion's a tricky thing. I know a lot of people struggle with this, and I'd love to hear about experiences from all sides of the argument.

If you're ever folding many sheets of paper (to make programs, for example), fold several at once, then separate them, stack them on top of each other, and press down on all of the folded edges together at once to make the initial crease sharp. Though it saves time, many people avoid trying to fold many sheets at once because the folds on the outer edge are never as crisp as you'd like them.

I've never been to Japan before.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the distant past, there was no life on this planet. Now there is not just life but hugely diverse ecosystems and complex human societies. Some scientists believe that what happened in between was a series of highly unlikely coincidences, one of which resulted in the formation of the first cells. But I prefer a hypothesis that everything we see around us is just sort of what happens when the conditions are right. That when there is a source of energy and the right chemical nutrients, the progression from non-life to life, from simple to complex, is a gradual but almost inevitable one. That the deep interrelationship between life and its planetary environment (sometimes called Gaia theory) is as old if not older than life itself; that life did not cause Gaia so much as arise from it.\r\n\r\nIn Tokyo my job will be to work out some of the details of how complex, life-like phenomena can arise from non-living physical systems. The aim is not to create life but to understand something about it by studying things that are similar but simpler. For me, understanding nature on a deep and mathematical level is a way to unlock and appreciate its beauty.

I find games are a great way to socialize with your friends and family.\r\n\r\nMy favorite board game is Risk, especially the non-traditional versions.  I love Risk 2210 A.D. which is a futuristic version.  Another board game that is a lot of fun is Dicecapades.  It\u2019s a great party game with lots of dice.  The challenges range from physical to mental.\r\n\r\nCard games in general are great.  I grew up playing games like Pinochle and Michigan Rummy and have taught my friends how to play them.  One of my favorite card games nowadays is Apples to Apples.  It\u2019s always interesting and usually funny to see what types of cards people will play.\r\n\r\nOf course I wouldn\u2019t call myself a gamer if I didn\u2019t play video games.  One of my favorites is Super Smash Bros. Brawl because you can fight each other with your favorite Nintendo characters.  Tetris Worlds is another favorite because you can really mess with each other in knock-out mode.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m also a huge fan of Dungeons & Dragons.  D&D is a table-top role playing game where you make a character and play through a campaign of the dungeon masters choosing.

        "My cousin got married last night. She is the first among my generation to get married, so this is the first time in over a decade that this branch of the family has been all in one place. Right now many of the people I care most about are recovering in the next room. The ceremony was beautiful, the food was wonderful, and a 10PM noise ordinance means we will talk forever about the cops shuting down the DJ at the reception.\r\n\r\nSo here is my advice:\r\n\r\nLove your family. You don't always have to like them, but love them when you can.\r\n\r\nDon't stress the small stuff - it isn't a real party till the cops show up. (Or someone stomps off in a huff.)\r\n\r\nTravel - many of the guests (myself included) traveled 12+ hours to this party and not one person regrets a moment of it.\r\n\r\nLive in the moment - Grandma can\u2019t remember anything that happened 5 seconds ago, but she spent hours last night in her chair at the party watching everything. She had no idea what was happening or who was getting married but she was thrilled to be at the party.\r\n\r\nThat said, I hope you all have a chance to be as happy as I am right now. I have my family around me, beautiful vistas of the mountains of Tuscon outside the windows, and nothing to do but bask in the post-wedding serenity until my 7AM flight tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecki\t\r\nintrepidcat@gmail.com\t\r\nWashington DC\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve] Be excellent to each other....", 
        "Michael Sean Bradley", 
        "\"Only a life lived for others is a life worth living\" (Albert Einstein)\r\n\r\n   It is easy for each of us to get caught up in the minutiae of every day life. I have pursued posessions and sought answers in religion and in learned books but have returned to one simple truth - true bliss exists only in being of service to others. \r\n\r\n   It is not about any particular set of morality. We are all part of a global community. Our existence is made easier by that community and we are beholden to it and to each other. John Hobbes wrote about the state of nature being \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\" and in order to avoid that we formed communities. Your life is made easier and better by your connections to each other and it is our duty and our privilege to support one another. The more we become connected and help one another, the more we all benefit. Call it selfish selflessness.  \r\n\r\n   I find bliss in working with disabled individuals to help them find dignity and respect. I take this opportunity to ask each of you to take time in your lives to be of service to one another. It can be big or small. It will be easy to dismiss this email as another burden on you, but try for a moment to remember times someone has helped you. \r\n\r\nPlease take this to heart and find some way to be of service to someone everyday, it will change you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Sean Bradley\r\nbouldermichael@hotmail.com\r\nBoulder, CO\r\n\r\n",

        "[The Listserve]  Music from the Doughnut Hole", 
        "Chris Hiester", 
        "One day in 1999 I stood on a subway platform in Boston as a banjo player named Bob Sundstrom played \"Pennies from Heaven\". I was mesmerized and I bought his cassette on the spot. The songs were old Tin Pan Alley numbers from the 1920's that were chock full of wit lyrical inventiveness. A few years later when I heard John Lithgow's \"Singin' in the Bathtub\" I had the same giddy feeling.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there is a doughnut hole in access to some historical music. Classical radio stations mostly emphasize music made up until 1900 and rock stations never play anything made before 1950, but there are many great songs from 1900-1950. Maybe you're like me and you sometimes get tired of the same three chords and the same story about couples breaking up. Maybe you also yell at your radio when you hear that Franz Ferdinand song that is ripped off of Led Zeppelin's \"Talkin' 'Bout Love\" or the One Direction song that is a copy of Sheila E's \"Glamorous Life\". If so, it's OK take a break and listen to some Songs from Halcyon Days (that was the title of \"Banjo\" Bob Sundstrom's cassette). Many of those old songs are more complex thought-provoking than a lot of the stuff you'll hear today and the beauty of Internet radio services like Pandora is you can discover this music easily. It won't force pop radio stations to include a few Cole Porter or Mississippi John Hurt songs when they make their lists of greatest songs of \"all time\", but you'll know they belong there. Now I think I'll go start up my Fats Waller station on Pandora.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Hiester\t\r\nchris@hiester.com\t\r\nPhiladelphia, PA\r\n\r\n",

By awe, I mean a sense of wonder at the mystery of existence or the size of the universe--a sort of overpowering ecstasy mingled with just a little bit of melancholy or existential dread. So for example, maybe awe is what you feel when you look up at the stars, or into your child's eyes. If you're religious, maybe you experience awe when you feel the presence of God. Whatever awe means to you, and whatever shape it takes, I want to hear about it.\r\n\r\nYour answer can take the form of a straightforward explanation, a story, a poem, a drawing, a video, a photograph, a song, or whatever else you want. It doesn't even have to be your creation; if a Beatles song makes you feel awe, then send me a YouTube link to that Beatles song. If someone said or wrote something which inspires awe, then quote them. Your answer can be anonymous or not, but I do at least want to know where you're from.\r\n\r\nSend your answers to the email below, or go to Tumblr and search for the tag \"wonderserv\" for further instructions.\r\n\r\nI'll take the best answers--which is to say, the answers that make me feel at least an echo of your awe--and post them on the tumblog you find using that tag.

It's much more easier if I enjoy it...or at least tell myself (out loud) why it's good for me and why I like it. I like running because I'm in control not my body. Going for a run is good for my self-discipline, it also helps me to get out of my comfort zone. It's amazing how much power our mind (and through it our self-talk) has. Use it for you not against you. Just listen to what you say  - are you helping and supporting or exhausting yourself (and others).  You\u2019re in charge to control what you say. If you don't like some qualities that you have, change them. Through changing self-talk and self-image you can become the person you have always wanted to be. It's not easy but completely doable.

        "I just graduated in May with a MS in biology, focused on animal physiology and biomechanics. I learned many things about myself during my graduate education; in particular, I learned that I truly don't want to continue in biology. Suffice to say, killing my research animals made quite an impression.\r\n\r\nThroughout my studies, I had a growing interest in pointing my biomechanics knowledge less toward animal systems and more toward robotics. My interests grew until finally I broke biology ranks and took an introductory robotics course through the computer science department at my university the semester before I graduated. I didn't have the background everyone else in the room did, and I spent a lot of time outside of class catching myself up on unfamiliar material. I loved every second of it. \r\n\r\nMy new goal is to develop this interest to the point that I can pursue a graduate degree in robotics and make contributions in that field. Since I'm now out of school, a lot of this development is must be done informally. I'm documenting the process on my blog, robotfrogblog.blogspot.com. I'm hoping to use this record as a way to keep myself motivated, to follow my progress, and especially once I have something concrete in my new graduate school search, to set an example for anyone else out there who finds themselves wanting to re-chart their course. As I've been told, it's never too late to start over... or to change. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\nPaula Sandusky\r\npsandusky@gmail.com \r\nTampa, FL, USA\r\n\r\n",

Maybe I was/am crazy. It was just a lot culminating at me losing my footing. I forgot to stand up and fight back. I forgot to do what I had to. Anyway, I know better now. I don't see it as a failure anymore. It is just everything never to do again for me. My parents don't know I am repeating my year of study. In fact, most of my family and friends don't. Instead, I chose to tell you guys. 20000+ strangers, few I know and have met, but mostly strangers. \r\n\r\nI like to write in my spare time. Very very few people know this about me.

Temptations teasing so close by. Fights and flailing at a distance. With cross paths you just meet once to maybe an explosion of souls. Then you move on to the unknown to never cross again. So which one do you choose? I say take neither. Pick a line and stay on it. Sometimes behind, sometimes ahead. Other times above if not below. Yet on the same path.

        "Hi! I\u2019m a 32-year-old Karachi girl living in Dubai. I dance a lot, even though I\u2019m terrible at it. But that\u2019s ok, because I\u2019d rather be bad at doing something I enjoy, than be good at doing something I hate.\r\n\r\nI believe life is too short to spend doing things - or being with people - you don\u2019t really like. So just focus your energy on the people and things that you love.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to work for a living, but not live for working. With the exception of the lucky few who have found a way to make money doing something they truly love and enjoy, most of us work fulltime jobs just to make ends meet, and there\u2019s nothing wrong in admitting that. So come in to work on time and leave on time, and enjoy real life.\r\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people say, money is not evil. Money is great. It gives you the freedom to do as much or as little as you want, for yourself and for others. It gives you the power to help other people. It gives you the luxury of exploring your own self. So don\u2019t be embarrassed to admit that you love money. I sure do!\r\n\r\n\u201cStay hungry, stay foolish\u201d are four words have been quoted ad nauseam, but I believe that better advice has never been dispensed in fewer words.\r\n\r\nI also believe that is no such thing as \u201cThe One\u201d. The power for someone to be The One resides not in them, but in you. It can be whoever you want it to be, or it can be no one.\r\n\r\nBut once you find someone you love and who loves you back, hold on to them. Fight like mad dogs if you have to, but also kiss and make up. Because no matter how bad things get, if you have a shoulder to rest your head on and a hand to wipe your tears, you will get through it.\r\n\r\nLove and light,\r\n\r\n\r\nUjala Ali Khan\r\nUjala_far@yahoo.com\r\nDubai, UAE\r\n\r\n",

The friends that I really knew, they were gone to me, and the friends that I could still go on with, expected me with my other group. So it is this I say, treasure them. Treat every day with them as it could be the last. I didn't know that lesson before this, and it still haunts me. I've spent nearly 30 weeks more or less alone, and I wake up each day forgetting that I'm alone, and I go to sleep missing each and every one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous \r\nastoryforlistserve@gmail.com\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\n",

        "We all have desires. We want to to eat, enjoy sensual pleasure, make money, gain recognition. None of these are bad per se, but often these desires are misdirected towards not-so-great ends. We as a race have sought to control these desires from the very beginning. It's perhaps what Plato referred to as Justice, Aristotle as eudaimonia, Hindu's as moksha, Muslims as Sufism, or spiritual elevation by many.\r\n\r\nAt the core of all of these philosophies is the idea that Mankind is Free. Not freedom in a democratic sense, freedom in a spiritual sense. Man is free to control and direct the desires of the heart.\r\n\r\nIf you start the process of restructuring yourself to be truly free, you may be plagued with painful Socratic questions. Are you in startup land to 'make it big' or are you there to have others see you make it big? Are you paying attention to your friend so that he or she may pay attention to you later, or do you truly care?\r\n\r\nAs you keep rising above your own self, you may begin to ask if there\u2019s something more meaningful than your own whims and fancies? Perhaps we exist for the service of others? To be free then, is to be free from the shackles of the self. Only when you\u2019re truly free may these so called 'cliches' of Compassion, Generosity, and Justice truly flow from your being.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out if you\u2019re striving towards things larger than yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\nasceticlife212@gmail.com\t\r\nNew York, New York\r\n\r\n",

There is only our natural world. Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds.\"\r\n\r\nThink about it. Oh, and if by any chance any of these subscribers are NHL players and/or owners; End this damn lockout. I miss hockey.  Go Sharks! Go Niners! Go SF Giants!

        "Scout's pace means moving at a brisk pace by alternately walking and running. Baden-Powell himself recommended alternating every fifty paces, but I prefer twenties as it's easier to count. My perennial optimism about how long it takes to walk somewhere makes me do it, and I enjoy breaking records for regular trips. I like the control that comes from having a number of \"gears\" at my disposal--easy strolling, brisk marching, an unpressured trot, the truth of a life lived under my own steam, and feeling... fit and well.\r\n\r\nScout's pace is obviously only the English term: do it a bit harder and you're speaking Norwegian: a fartlek. As for what the technique's most legendary exponents--the nomads of the Kalahari--call it, I have !kno idea! It is only the blink of an evolutionary eye since we were all hunter-gatherers; and yet we have forgotten Scout's pace, with dreadful consequences. Many ills of the Western lifestyle--obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, stress and depression--can be traced to our lack of exercise.\r\n\r\nI, too lazy and too ambitious to walk all my life, have transferred this knowledge to the bicycle. I could have discussed the virtues of a 24:32 minimum development, or the necessity of mudguards, or the late 19th century campaign by cyclists for paved roads, that led, in time, to the lamentable car culture, but I wanted to stick to the basics.\r\n\r\nRegards to all,\r\n\r\nD. \r\n\r\n\r\nDouglas Carnall \r\nTranslator and editor \r\ndougie.carnall@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",

        "Look up my friend, look up to that night sky above you. Those stars you see, impossibly far from where you stand, are the same ones I see. Those stars, some have witnessed the birth of humanity, others burned out a millennium ago and all we see is an echo. Impossibly far away, yet  impossibly close, I hope the vastness of the universe makes your troubles melt away and brings you back to another time, I know it brings me back.  I see these stars over me, and I am comforted by that fact that the same stars shine over your head. One day, that may be the last connection we old friends have. It is a promise, a promise that as the years pass, we will never be completely alone. That we will always have this, a faded photo, a scribbled note, a memory of days gone by. A promise that us two weary travelers one day will meet again, and watch the stars together again, separated by neither mountain nor sea.\r\n\r\nThis is something that's been evolving for a year now. I wrote the second half last year for my girlfriend,  this piece of writing will forever be hers. I wrote the first half after we broke up, then tonight I finished it off. Its one of my favorite things Ive ever written, short and sweet, it brings me right back to one cold night last year looking up at the stars with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrendan Illis\r\nbrendan.illis@illisimages.com\t\r\nNew Jersey USA\r\n\r\n",

        "I am writing this from my tiny apartment in Madison, Wisconsin. I have realized the low rent I pay is directly related to the fact that I overlook an intersection on the preferred street of emergency vehicles, which means they lay heavily on the horn, at all hours of the night, to cross through red lights. It does not bother me in the least. The sirens remind me that we are all emergencies, at one time or another. I\u2019m also reminded to turn off the oven.\r\n\r\nI recently began my first full-time job working for the state. I am a man who thinks deeply and laboriously about where I am in life, where I could be, and how best to do the right thing at all times. I am surprised to find myself a civil servant, but I believe a government is only as good as the people who run it. I feel I am a good person, so I accept trading my spoken word poet\u2019s cap for an oxford button down and a name badge. I leave work daily feeling fulfilled.\r\n\r\nLastly, I know for certain only a few things.\r\n-My wife and I keep each other warm.\r\n-There is inherent power in a smile.\r\n-Also, in being silent, sometimes.\r\n-Being wronged gives you a unique advantage over the one who wronged you: the ability to forgive him.\r\n-I am afraid of forgetting.\r\n\r\nPlease try to be safe, creative, and read more short stories.
