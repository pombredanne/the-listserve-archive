        "[The Listserve] A tip to boost (or awake) your superpowers", 
        "Alexander Demenshin", 
        "Sometimes, we cannot recall things which we want to recall, and we cannot see a full picture due to missing details.\r\n\r\nWe are afraid to make a decision since we don't know the outcome, and all this leads to mistakes that we prefer to avoid.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if our memory was like a hard drive, so we could store and recall anything any time, and if we could correlate all events from the past and see all connections.\r\n\r\nThis way, we could make no mistakes and precisely forecast the future.\r\n\r\nBut... our memory is not a hard drive, thus, it cannot work that way.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is something that we can do to improve this:\r\n\r\n- When you are preparing to sleep, lying in the bed, try to recall all events of the past day, exactly in the order as they happened, with all details. - If you are finished and still awake - try previous day, and so on. - Next morning, after waking up, briefly recall previous day.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you will feel the boost. Your memory will improve, you will begin to see the future, you will intuitively avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut please, be patient - it could take days, weeks or even months, this is very individual, so don't panic if nothing happens quickly - eventually, it will - or money back :)\r\n\r\nJust be persistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Demenshin\t \r\nal.dem@nk7.net\t\r\nDuesseldorf, Germany\r\n\r\n",

        "In two weeks, I'm getting on a plane with my best friend Haley and we're going to southern Spain (Seville, specifically). We have a few places in particular we're planning to visit (Granada, Cadiz, Ronda, Lisbon), but we've got seven whole weeks to see and do, well, pretty much whatever.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering what you guys thought. Have you been to any places in western Europe that you'd adamantly recommend? Cities, beaches, specific bars or shops, fishing villages...whatever, really. What do you think is cool?\r\n\r\nAlso, if you live in a cool place in western Europe and maybe want to meet up for coffee or cervezas or something, you should email me.

        "Call home; whether it\u2019s the physical building you grew up in or where you went to school, just call home. Call your fraternity brothers or sorority sisters. Call your childhood best friend. Call your mother, father, and siblings. I am still fairly young but as I\u2019ve aged, I\u2019ve realized how easy it is to let relationships fade and to forget your roots. All of my successes and achievements are the results of many people over the years. I am the product of countless acquaintances and deep friendships. Every person I have met has had some effect on the knowledge I hold, my outlook on life, and the steps I have taken to end up where I am. Whether the encounters were positive or negative, I have to thank them all because I am pretty happy with the way things turned out.\r\n\r\nSo take the time to reflect on where you are and how you got here. Think about the people that have mattered to you throughout this journey; then reach back. Maybe the phone call will not be as satisfying as you anticipated but who knows? That call might in fact be just what the other person needed to uplift them from a rough week. Saying hello is easy and goes a long way.\r\n\r\nJust do it, right now, go ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenson\r\nStanford, CA\r\n\r\n",

        "When we were planning our wedding, Kristen and I talked about names. I started from the assumption that she would be taking mine; she started from the assumption that we would make that decision together.\r\n\r\nSo I told her that I had always believed my wife would take my name, that it seemed natural. That I would feel awkward otherwise. She talked about giving up that part of her identity and I pretended like I understood. I waxed on about starting a new family and how we would want to have the same name.\r\n\r\nHere is the thing, though. On a really fundamental level the person that wants to have a conversation is always correct. She knew I was being an asshole (are cusses okay on this list? I waffled on the terminology but I was a real dick about the name thing) but instead of getting angry she kept talking to me, and I got it through my head that just because something is socially common doesn't mean it's not a burden.\r\n\r\nWe picked a new name, for our new family, and that's how we became the Maderas.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Madera \r\njamesm.madera@gmail.com \r\nHarrisburg PA\r\n\r\nps i'm not telling you how to live your life but if you're going to do this get his name changed before the wedding so it's free to change hers after, otherwise changing names is hundreds of dollars\r\n\r\npps i'm seriously not defending my behavior through that process, I'm still a little ashamed of my baseline assumption, but I figured it's worth acknowledging because I guarantee a lot of decent people have struggled with that, feel free to email me with whatever thoughts you have on the subject!\r\n\r\n",

        "It is interesting to me how science is largely misused, misquoted, and misunderstood by the vast majority of people around the world. We haven\u2019t even come that far in our scientific understanding of the world, yet it seems to me that we are in danger of slipping back toward the times when scientists were feared and derided for their ideas, and churches and warlords made the decisions for us all.\r\n\r\nI see it now all around: anti-vaccination movements, and anti-fluoridation movements, for example. Conspiracy theories and junk-science are beginning to over power public and private discussion. Even the very notion of intellectualism is no longer a desirable trait.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m thinking of Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist, who at one point said at that he isn\u2019t worried so much about today\u2019s children.

        "So as a recently turned 21 year old, I feel I don't know as much as almost everybody else here on the listserve. I have no wise words, no humbling story, but by no means do I live an unfulfilled life. I\u2019ve found in my short, but fun filled existence that if you want to do something then you should never let things hold you back.\r\n\r\n             I know there are certain circumstances which don\u2019t allow you to fulfil goals and objectives, but surely there\u2019s a way around them? A lot of the time we\u2019re creating our own barriers that hold us back because were too comfortable in what we know. So I challenge you, the reader to go out there and do something different, something that gets you one step further to what you want out of life, and do it with a smile on your face, because as a drunken man once said to me \u201cWhy are you young ones so angry?\u201d\r\n\r\n             Another thing I\u2019ve learnt so far is never to be jealous of others. It\u2019s the easiest way to bring yourself down. Just be comfortable with what you can, or even can\u2019t do and take solace in the fact that somebody will be jealous of you at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks for reading, Matt.\r\nmattymoomoomoo@hotmail.co.uk\t\r\nU.K\r\n\r\nP.S If anybody out there knows of any theatre comedies that aren\u2019t well known, please feel free  to send them my way, as I am very.

This may not seem like a huge thing now, but it was then.\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring it up now is because the institution he founded, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, is in trouble.

All these dreams I've had for us, for me, didn't end because my marriage ended, or I couldn't finance them or find time to breathe life into them. They ended because I gave up on them; resigned myself to the fact that life was always going to be hard. So, I put my dreams on paper and figured out what I needed to do to make them happen. I wrote down what it would feel like to accomplish them. I'm not talking about buying stuff or jetting around the world. I'm talking about living!\r\n\r\nAnd yesterday, exhausted, I almost gave in and slept. Then I saw this pinned to the board above my desk: \u201cDon't give up what you LOVE most for what you WANT now.\u201d My bucket list contains one item: I want to live someplace beautiful. Everything else will fall into place from there. Taking a nap in the miserable heat won't get me there.

        "Jared", 
        "Politicians, pundits, and religious figures say the Bible dictates how you should vote on certain issues. Unfortunately, much of it is not true.\r\n\r\nAbortion: It\u2019s not murder, and the penalty for causing a miscarriage against the will of the mother can be a simple fine (Exodus 21). Sometimes God calls for pregnant women (and the fetus) to be put to death (Genesis 38).\r\n\r\nContraception and masturbation: The Bible is silent on these issues. God killed Onan for coitus interruptus (\u201cspilling his seed\u201d), as punishment for refusing to impregnate his brother\u2019s widow (Genesis 38).\r\n\r\nHomosexuality: The Bible says all sex outside of a marriage is wrong and does not differentiate for homosexual acts. But in the same places it also prohibits eating shellfish, tattoos, divorce, wearing gold, wearing clothes made of two different cloths, and other rules absurd to modern society that the church ignores (e.g. Leviticus 11). Why aren\u2019t they protesting retailers and seafood restaurants?\r\n\r\nMarriage: While you may hear that the Bible defines marriage as \u201cone man, one woman\u201d (it doesn\u2019t), it actually has examples of \u201cone man, many women\u201d, \u201ca rapist and his victim\u201d, \u201ca soldier and prisoner of war\u201d.\r\n\r\nWealth: Jesus says it\u2019s hard for the rich to get into heaven, and people should give away all of their possessions. Not tax cuts for the rich.\r\n\r\nBible\u2019s literal truth: Our modern Bible has thousands of changes from the original texts (read any Bart Ehrman book).\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let people cynically manipulate you for their personal gain or prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nJared\t\r\ngoogoljared@gmail.com\t\r\nAtlanta, GA (USA)\r\n\r\n",
