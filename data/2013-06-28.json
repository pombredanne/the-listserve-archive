["[The Listserve] Seize the Septum Ring", "Matt", "First of all, to all of you past Listserve writers, thank you for sharing.  I\u2019ve read each one from top to bottom.  Whether strictly informational or a vent of something that\u2019s been bottled up too long or something else entirely, each Listserve email is, in itself, an insight into how various people choose to use a loudspeaker moment.  I didn\u2019t join in the hopes of having that moment; I joined to see what others would do with theirs.  Yet now I\u2019ve been caught in the spotlight, and who am I to chicken out?\r\n\r\nMany Listservers have shared their own rules, mottos, inspirational messages, etc. on how to get going with life: Carpe Diem, one foot in front of the other, don\u2019t fear failure, put yourself out there, learn something new, etc.  I don\u2019t want to pooh-pooh any of that, but much of it is easier said than done.  Fear of failure can be pretty darned ingrained in people.  And how does one seize a day?  Does it have horns or a septum ring one can latch on to?\r\n\r\nMotivational speeches, slogans, and pep talks are great if they happen to apply to you and your unique situation at that particular point in your life.  They can get us jacked up and excited, which is usually good.  But without anything tangible to put that jacked-up excitement into, the Jack who\u2019s popped from the box goes limp and the music stops.  (Yes, I know there\u2019s a that\u2019s-what-she-said joke in there somewhere.)\r\n\r\nSo what should come next?  Well, I hate to present a problem without a possible solution, so I\u2019ll share what I think.  First, slow down, hot shot.  Don\u2019t go sprinting off whatever couch you\u2019ve been sitting on and seize the first septum ring you see, thinking it\u2019s attached to a diem.  What you\u2019re looking to do is apprentice from someone else who is more advanced than you.  I\u2019m not talking about any Donald Trump crap; think Ben Franklin.  This works for virtually everything and can give you tangible tasks toward reasonable goals.  To be a good apprentice, you need three things: someone who is a good teacher of beginner-level and novice work, a master-level practitioner whose techniques you can dissect and model, and someone who will watch you closely and keep you accountable.  If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll find all three in one person.  If not, make due; you\u2019ll be fine.\r\n\r\nBut it does mean asking for help, which is often the hardest part.\r\n\r\nWant to be a writer?  Read your favorite author over and over and over, dissecting what he or she is doing, take some classes, and join/create a writer\u2019s group.  Want to be happier?  Search out someone truly, consistently happy (not just delusional), and tell someone who cares about you that you\u2019re not happy.  They\u2019ll help.  Get the idea?  I want to be a great father for my kids, but, as much as I love my own, I apprentice from my childless uncle who actually got down on the floor and played silly games with us when we were kids.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the love of whatever God/gods you believe in, if you ever see someone struggling, help.  Whether it\u2019s a hug or teaching the ways of the printing press, the human race advances only through the sharing of kindness and experience.\r\n\r\nBut before I reach my word limit, watch Bill Murray\u2019s \u201cRazor\u2019s Edge.\u201d  Listen to Buckethead\u2019s \u201cMonsters and Robots\u201d and R.L. Burnside\u2019s \u201cA Ass Pocket of Whiskey.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt\t\r\nmstilty@yahoo.com\t\r\nOregon/USA\r\n\r\n", [2013, 6, 28]]
