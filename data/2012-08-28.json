["[The Listserve] Those who can, do; those who can\u2019t, teach.", "Leah Johnson", "Why do people become teachers? I often wonder this as I constantly read and see the attack on teachers and public education in general. This question is particularly interesting to me because of my profession- I teach future teachers. I teach learning theories, motivational theories, and theories about working with diverse populations. However, I am at a loss about explaining the complexities of teaching in today\u2019s climate. Do I tell my students the truth about how hard it will be? That they will work 10-12 hour days most of the year with pay that does not correspond to having a professional degree and license. That they will be told constantly that they must do or try one new thing,even if they don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for their students. Or do I tell them to remember their passion. To love and teach their students as if they were their own children. I hope I can balance the truth with the hope that I have for my students.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeah Johnson\t\r\nJohnson.leah85@gmail.com\t\r\nFort Wayne, Indiana, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 28]]
