["[The Listserve] The Quest", "Sarah Ouderkirk", "---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCHASING BLISS\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeday some hypermanic kid\r\nwill produce a moronically maxed-out adventure odyssey\r\nthat will spark the overdue rebellion\r\namong all the over-pressured SAT grinds,\r\nand us grumpy midlife critics\r\nwill get to witness a new Kerouac,\r\nand the greatest pent-up young-life crisis\r\nin the history of the world.\r\n    - David Brooks, \u201cSal Paradise at 50,\u201d NY Times, 2007\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is about a quest. An ordinary quest -- no dragons, sorcerers, mythical beasts. I wish. This is about my journey into the soul. Now I know what you're thinking. Not another egotistical self-absorbed desperate whiny journey into the soul.* Why would you want to read that? No. Like I said, this is about a quest.\r\n\r\nStep one: Abandon >all< earthly possessions.\r\n\r\n    Well, almost. I have a backpack. A light one, with no more than a few toiletries, sleeping bag, a few extra shirts.\r\n    And I have a boyfriend, whom I love almost as much as life itself. He\u2019s not coming with me. I can\u2019t even imagine life without him. He is Mr. Perfect in every sense of the word. His name is Michael. I could write a whole book about how much I love Michael. In fact, I did. It\u2019s my diary. Not for publication.\r\n    Anyway, he is the reason why Step #2 is REALLY REALLY HARD!\r\n\r\nStep two: Buy a 1-way ticket to the other side of the world.\r\n\r\nStep #3: Go on the greatest adventure of your young life.\r\n\r\nBut before I get ahead of myself, like I said, this is about a quest. There is a back story. In order to appreciate the full meaning of the quest, you need to know the back story. If you would rather skip right to the adventure, see p. __ (How to talk your way out of paying police bribes in Nepal) or maybe p. __ (Sleeping through terrorist attacks outside your window). But trust me, you want the back story.\r\n\r\nLike many young middle-class Americans, I went to college. I went to a good college, University of Washington.\r\n\r\nNo, wait. Back up. This whole mess started with the SAT. That fucking standardized test. During high school, I was convinced I was going to be an artist. I wanted to go to art school. But my parents, of course, wanted me to go to a respectable school and pursue a respectable career -- one that would actually make money.\r\n\r\nSound familiar?? Doesn\u2019t every young person go through something like this???\r\n\r\nSo I took the SAT. And I got my score, like everyone else. But while everyone else was looking at their scores thinking \u201cFuck, I\u2019ll never get into Harvard with a 1080!\u201d I was looking at my score thinking someone vastly OVER-estimated my intelligence. Someone at the switch messed up. Pushed a button. Dropped a box full of files. Maybe some poor sorry 22 year-old at the SAT office never learned how to alphabetize, mixed up Sarah Ouderkirk with Sarah Actually-wants-to-go-to-college, or Sarah Grew-up-in-the-Ghetto-and-really-deserves-this-opportunity, or a BILLION other Sarahs ...\r\n\r\nBut there was no mistake. I was doomed. Cursed with an above-average SAT score, my  parents and everyone else expected me to go to college.\r\n\r\nSo I applied.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n@ Reply with \u201cQuest\u201d in the subject line and I\u2019ll send you more.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSarah Ouderkirk\r\nLa Jolla, California, USA\r\nsokirk@gmail.com\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 11]]
