["[The Listserve] From a Student", "Tim Krins", "When I received the email telling me I could write a letter to 20,000 people, I smiled. The timing was hilarious.\r\nThe last four days have been the most amazing in my life... but that is a different story (you can ask me about it via email if you like).\r\n\r\nAfter hours and hours of thought, this is a thank you, a thank you to all teachers who approach their jobs and roles with energy, sincerity and enthusiasm. Parents and community leaders too, but especially to those in high school education.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m one of those students... you most likely know the type.\r\nThe sort of student who loves to learn, but is much less thrilled with proving what I have learned.\r\nYou took the time, made the effort and encouraged me to persist, to be better, and even though my marks didn\u2019t quite make it, you still taught me with the same passionate enthusiasm as always.\r\n\r\nJust so you know - I\u2019m 22 now - travelling the world, meeting new people, having exciting and challenging adventures.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m doing it with that exact same enthusiasm, sincerity and energy you used when you were teaching me some idea that flew right over my head.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of all students, thank you for your interest in our lives, and for sharing your passion.\r\nI hope someday I can find the patience, wisdom and heart to do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nTim Krins\r\ntimkrins@gmail.com\r\nMelbourne, Australia\r\n(Currently in Vancouver, Canada)\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 25]]
