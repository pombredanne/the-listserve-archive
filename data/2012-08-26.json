["[The Listserve] The View From 65", "Penny Rice", "Embrace love in all of its forms, live with a strong connection to your higher self, laugh loudly and often \u2026 with yourself as your main source of amusement.\r\n\r\nEliminate manufactured fear.  Root out all messages and warnings of fear instilled within you by parents, teachers, leaders, TV, media and your imagination.  Look around you and see the ways you are safe, secure and empowered.  Regardless of your circumstances, there is good in your life.  See it, acknowledge it, enjoy it and be thankful.\r\n\r\nLife is an adventure.  There\u2019re opportunities every day to learn new things, meet new people, gain new perspective and explore new ideas \u2026 many only appear once.  Don\u2019t miss them.\r\n\r\nTell your truth of the moment.  (It will evolve as you grow and change.)  Be authentic by your definition, not what others cast upon you.\r\n\r\nTreat each person you meet as the unique individual they are.  Learn something from every person.  Notice their eyes; their spirit, their beauty.  Acknowledge them with a smile, nod or thought.\r\n\r\nBecome aware of your negative and judgmental thoughts.  Counter them with love.  Forgive yourself for actions that have hurt others. Vow to change the behavior. Forgive those who have hurt you because in doing so, you make room for love, laughter and joy.\r\n\r\nRemember and honor those who have loved, cherished, protected, guided, taught, and, yes, even those who have pissed you off.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, Love is a much better place from which to live a life.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nPenny Rice\r\npennyskysinger@gmail.com\r\nColumbia, Maryland USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 26]]
