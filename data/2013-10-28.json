I think the mind is a muscle that requires exercise in order to be healthy and strong. My father lived to 88 and enjoyed nearly 30 years of retirement, largely, I feel, due to his insatiable curiosity and desire to learn new things.\r\n\r\nFour years ago as an adult I started playing the cello. It\u2019s a surprisingly difficult instrument to learn to play well. And music is endlessly complex, with layer upon layer of nuance and meaning to ferret out and understand.\r\n\r\nI have what I call an \u201cinfinite list\u201d. This is the ever growing list of things I wish to learn or experience. The content of the list is less important, I feel, that having it and having the desire and drive to keep tackling new topics and new experiences.\r\n\r\nAge is a state of mind and as long as your mind is young and supple I think you can be ageless \u2014 at least to some extent.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s on your infinite list?\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Nichols\r\ncodeprole+listserv@gmail.com\r\nManhattan Kansas\r\n\r\n", [2013, 10, 28]]
