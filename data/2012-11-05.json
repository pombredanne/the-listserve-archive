["[The Listserve] My two words", "Aniruddh Behere", "So the story goes.....A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold that the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! \r\nHe lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing under the pile of cow dung and promptly dug him out and ate him.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story:\r\n\r\n(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. \r\n(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. \r\n(3) If you are happy and warm in a pile of shit then it's smart to keep your mouth shut!\r\n\r\n.........and the doctor recommends (I really am one) :-\r\n\r\n1) Make an effort to smile everyday, it will help you live longer.\r\n2) Don't forget how to use a pen. 2) Enjoy your single malt scotch as it was intended...straight and unadulterated. 3) Take time to sit with your eyes closed for atleast 10 minutes...it will open up your mind. \r\n4) Read IF by Rudyard Kipling and Auguries of Innocence by Wiliam Blake.\r\n5) Everything will be alright at the end, if it's not alright then it's not the end\r\n\r\nLive long and prosper my friends!\r\n\r\n\r\nAniruddh Behere \r\naniruddhbehere@gmail.com\t \r\nSpringfield Illinois, USA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 5]]
