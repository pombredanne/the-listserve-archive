["[The Listserve] My Ride or Die", "Kimmie", "My mother always wanted me to write about her for those radio show contests. She stopped asking but I never did it. I felt the public recognition wasn\u2019t necessary. She\u2019s my best friend, the one who keeps me going when I can\u2019t motivate myself. I love her to death and don\u2019t know where I would be without her.\r\n\r\nShe became a single mother when my dad was killed. I was a baby. She didn\u2019t crumble but fought back. My family\u2019s life hasn\u2019t been easy but she\u2019s managed to put me through an Ivy League University and support me in my current quest of attending medical school.\r\n\r\nI realize now that I should have entered her in some of those contests. Sometimes, private recognition isn\u2019t enough. So, here it is \u2013 her recognition. This isn\u2019t a contest and she\u2019s not going to win a prize but you knowing is enough.\r\n\r\nDo me a favor; drop a note to the email address, stating that you heard about her story and what it means to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nKimmie\t\r\nbrigitti.brown87@gmail.com\t\r\nBaltimore City, Maryland\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 13]]
