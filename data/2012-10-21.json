["[The Listserve] I promise you will be glad you did.", "James Tall", "I have 250 words and have already used nine.\r\n\r\nI would have loved to write a public love letter to my wife, to my two daughters and tell everyone why I have the greatest parents, in-laws, siblings and family. I wanted to discuss the physics behind Baumgartner\u2019s recent free-fall from the edge of space, share the world's best pie and cookie recipes, debate survival strategies for the impending zombie apocalypse, and tell everyone why we should fight for capitalism, small government and a return to the gold standard.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not going to.\r\n\r\nInstead I will share a handful of my father's rules of survival. Read them slowly:\r\n\r\nIt is always my fault.\r\n\r\nNo problem is bigger than I am.\r\n\r\nNo one can offend me.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much good you do in the world, someone will always be pissed off at you.\r\n\r\nHow you make people feel will be remembered long after they forget what you say or what you accomplish.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much money you have, once you are married it is never enough.\r\n\r\nFinally, and most importantly, because I cannot put a link in my message, the most important thing I can possibly do with my 250 words is to direct you to search on Google the term \u201cI am a Mormon\u201d and follow the top link. Spend five minutes there. Learn about Jesus Christ, why we\u2019re here, true happiness and blessings that come from making good decisions. I promise you will be glad you did.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Tall\r\njhtall@gmail.com\t\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 10, 21]]
