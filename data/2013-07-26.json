["[The Listserve] I won?", "Broholm", "I stopped reading the listserve a while back because everyone seemed to be ranting about ways to live your life. I'm young (going off to college in the fall) and still figuring things out, so I don't exactly have any great wisdom to give you all, sorry. I thought about not writing this however, but it seemed cool enough to be a shame to give up. I'm pretty busy with things right now, so this is mostly just a rough draft. I'll leave you with the last book I read and movie I watched, maybe you'll like them too; \"museum of innocence\" by Orhan Pamuk and \"Drive\". Both are pretty good I thought. \r\n\r\nGood luck with things. \r\n\r\n\r\nBroholm\t\r\nBromieholmie@gmail.com\t\r\nMaryland, USA \r\n\r\n", [2013, 7, 26]]
