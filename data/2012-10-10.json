["[The Listserve] For you, a mixtape (biography)", "Elliot Darvick", "These five songs have shaped me as an individual, they have shaped the way I look at the world around me, and they have shaped my vision of the future I\u2019d like to live.\r\n\r\nS\u00e9bastien Tellier // La Ritournelle \u2013 I think I was already in love when I first heard this song, but in this song I disappeared deep into our life together. It\u2019s possible this is the world\u2019s most perfect song.\r\n\r\nBrother Ali // Rain Water \u2013 I first saw Ali perform almost 10 years ago in a dive bar above a movie theater in St. Louis. Last week he sold out the Bowery Ballroom in New York. I hold close his music and life story as a reminder that greatness takes years to achieve.\r\n\r\nAir // Run \u2013 To my dearest sister Emma. Your artwork is a gift to us all. I have come to accept that there are complexities and emotions behind it I may never understand \u2013 but this no longer gets in the way of me enjoying it.\r\n\r\nJay-Z // Beach Chair \u2013 \u201cI said from not being afraid to fall out the sky.\u201d Disrupting my comfort zone has never failed me as a means for achieving my desired path. Ad astra per aspera.\r\n\r\nDan Deacon // USA IV: Manifest \u2013 I am America. Through doubt, angst and struggle I push on, because at my core there is a tireless optimist driven by good values and the highest of aspirations.\r\n\r\nThank you for listening.\r\n\r\n\r\nElliot Darvick\r\nelliot@unbucket.com\r\nLos Angeles, CA\r\n\r\n", [2012, 10, 10]]
