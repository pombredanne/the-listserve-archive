["[The Listserve] Make things.", "Jeremy Penner", "You have something you always wanted to learn to do, but \r\nnever did.  Perhaps you were intimidated; maybe you didn't\r\nknow where to start.  Maybe you tried, but got frustrated.  \r\nMaybe you had grand plans that would have taken you years of \r\nconcentrated effort to pull off.\r\n\r\nHere is a thing that I am learning: It's okay to do it badly.\r\n\r\nSo your stick figures aren't even recognizable as people.  \r\nSo you knit a rectangular scarf that's somehow not a \r\nrectangle.  So the birdhouse you built is wonky.  So the \r\nprogram you wrote crashes if you look at it funny.  So you \r\npainted an ugly picture of your father in his underwear in \r\na recliner.  So the curtains you sewed sit funny on the rod.  \r\nSo you only know two chords on the guitar, and it takes you \r\na few seconds to switch between them.  So you made a video-\r\ngame that's ugly and weird and broken and nobody wants to \r\nplay.\r\n\r\nDo something that you're bad at.  Enjoy it anyway.\r\n\r\nMaybe get good at it, if you want.\r\n\r\nBut you've gotta do it badly first.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremy Penner\r\njeremy@sporktania.com\r\nOttawa, ON, Canada\r\n\r\n", [2012, 6, 8]]
