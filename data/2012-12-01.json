["[The Listserve] For the introverts and everyday man", "Katie Lee", "I was told a while ago that I should write a book about networking\u2026it was a joke. However, if you\u2019d like some random social advice from a UNC-Chapel Hill senior, here ya go:\r\n\r\n1)   Never be shy introducing yourself. Anytime you approach someone, whether at work or a bar, it\u2019s a compliment to them.\r\n\r\n     a.    People love to be approached for networking. Just by being interested you\u2019re telling them that you see them as an expert in their field and you\u2019d like to be where they are. I\u2019ve never had anyone be less than thrilled when I asked them about their experiences.\r\n\r\n     b.    Ex. I met the Partner and CCO at my advertising agency internship recently who everyone thought was intimidating. He\u2019s actually extremely open, easy to get along with and full of advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResulting from things that irk me:\r\n\r\n2)   If a girl is in a bar, she wants to be approached. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be the one to get her number or take her home, but don\u2019t be afraid to introduce yourself.\r\n\r\n     a.    Guys may have a fear of rejection, but we came out that night in our 5-inch heels to talk to someone.\r\n\r\n     b.    Hint: it might be scary to approach a pack of girls, but we\u2019re in the pack because we\u2019re just as nervous to approach you. The pack is safe, but we\u2019d rather break away.\r\n\r\n                                     i.     It\u2019s depressing when you catch a guy\u2019s eye and he smiles, but then never gets the courage to come up to you.\r\n\r\n3)   Know when to leave\r\n\r\n     a.    I recently had a guy follow me around a bar even after separating twice. He was nice at first, but when a girl tells you she has to find her friends, she isn\u2019t asking for help.\r\n\r\n4)   Don\u2019t become the \u201ccorner creeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     a.    It\u2019s surprising how many guys will literally stare a girl down like it\u2019s a pickup line. I wonder if that works on someone\u2026\r\n\r\n5)   I\u2019ll give you the best opening line that works on me: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Tyler. *smiles*.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA note to McLovett\u2026\r\n\r\nStop hating winter. I know it\u2019s freezing and dreary up there in Connecticut, and the days are shorter and darker, but it\u2019s the best time of the year. There\u2019s a calm about winter, when the air smells like burning wood and everything sparkles from the crystals on the trees. My favorite memories are from NY, sitting around a bon fire in snow with hot chocolate and family. Just enjoy the weather next to a fire with your favorite strawberry frosted mini wheats, and realize how much better summer is because you have to put up with winter. Don\u2019t be a Negative Nancy. Winter is wonderful.\r\n\r\n\r\nKatie Lee\r\nkatie.lee753@gmail.com\r\nChapel Hill, North Carolina\r\n\r\n", [2012, 12, 1]]
