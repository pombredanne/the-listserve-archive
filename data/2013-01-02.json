["[The Listserve] Stop The Return Of Bullfighting to TV", "Lily Limmer", "I'm going to get straight to the point. I'm 13 and I've created a petition; it's an issue I feel strongly about and my target is to reach 100 signatures. So far I have ninety nine... if I could get 1 person out of 20,000 of you to sign then it would be a success.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't give you a link or the HTML but if you google search \"stop the return of bullfighting to TV\" and click on the first link you'll have reached your destination. I created it via Avaaz community petitions but anyone can sign.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time. \r\n\r\n\r\nLily Limmer\t\r\nlilylimmer@yahoo.co.uk\t\r\nCrewkerne, Somerset\r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 2]]
