["[The Listserve] Nanni", "Talia Klein", "My grandmother is my best friend. I call her Nanni. Most people aren\u2019t as lucky as I am to have such a special person in their life, but I am and she is kind, wise, beautiful, intelligent, perfect. I am not telling her that I\u2019m writing this about her because she is so selfless that she would probably talk me into writing about something else, like Obama or art or women\u2019s health or exercising one\u2019s right to vote \u2013 all important things that she would want to share with 22,000 listeners. Nanni is a renaissance woman. She can do anything, but I\u2019m going to tell you some things that Nanni has taught me, and I live my life by these principles:\r\n\r\nBe passionate.\r\nDon\u2019t let anyone\u2019s opinion stand in the way of doing what you want.\r\nIf you care about something, fight for it.\r\nIf you love someone, tell them.\r\nIf you want to do something, the world is yours and you can do it.\r\nCommit to something and follow through.\r\nYou daresn\u2019t let anyone hold you back.\r\nEmbrace struggle and do what you can with the resources you\u2019ve got.\r\nLife is short.\r\nAlways try clothes on - they never look the same on your body as they do on the hanger.\r\nBeing unhappy is a choice, accepting failure and defeat isn't.\r\nAsk questions, read a lot, travel, stay organized and informed.\r\nIf you don\u2019t think you can, try harder.\r\n\r\nGrandparents are really special people. Don\u2019t forget to call yours and tell them you love \u2018em.\r\n\r\n\r\nTalia Klein\r\ntaliak91@gmail.com\r\nNew York, NY\r\n\r\n", [2012, 9, 15]]
