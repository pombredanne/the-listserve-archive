["[The Listserve] The Good Life", "Julissa Castillo", "As of this week, I have been in LA for 7 months pursuing my dream of becoming a TV writer. Though I work multiple jobs (none of them full-time), I may soon run out of money. Last week, I had an emotional breakdown upon realizing that I may have to give up on my dream (or at least go about it in a different way). I\u2019m alternating between wanting to throw in the towel, and wanting to push myself just a little bit harder in order to stay out here. Things are definitely a bit tough right now.\r\n\r\nBut, as I sit here on the floor of my bedroom, stress-eating Chex mix and inhaling caffeine while I complete work for one job before I go to work at another job, I just want to say:\r\n\r\nLife is good.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m healthy. I have a loving family and a caring boyfriend. I have a roof over my head and clothes on my back. If I died in a freak snowboarding accident, at least 10 people would miss me.\r\n\r\nWhenever people give me advice on my future, they all say something like, \u201cthings will work out in the end!\u201d or \u201cyour time is almost coming!\u201d But the thing is, it is just as possible that my time isn\u2019t coming, and things won\u2019t work out in the end.\r\n\r\nMaybe I never get to do what I wanted to do in my career. I\u2019ve already been so fortunate in ways that I take for granted every single day, and maybe my career is the one part of my life that won\u2019t be as I envisioned. I guess we\u2019ll find out.\r\n\r\nEither way, life is good.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I would love to hear from all of you, especially if you have some awesome life advice (or if you want to offer me a kickass job). No pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulissa Castillo\r\njmariecast@gmail.com\r\nLos Angeles, CA\r\n\r\nPS, Go \u2018Dores!\r\n\r\n", [2012, 8, 16]]
