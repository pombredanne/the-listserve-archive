["[The Listserve] Electronic Music and Interactive Technology", "Leif Bloomquist", "Whoops, I got the notice on Saturday and rarely check my emails on the weekends.  So here I am putting something together fairly quickly!\r\n\r\nThe Listserve is such a neat concept.  I want you all to know that I really do read (or, at least skim) each and every message you send. Especially, thanks to George F. (Guy) McHendry (A Matter of Words, Words that Matter), Jr. and Ryan (Productively Creative Thinking), whose emails I actually printed out and hung up over my desk at work. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit about myself.   I'm a software engineer at an aerospace company by day, which is pretty cool, but my passion is dabbling in electronic music and interactive technology with a view to its artistic and creative potential.\r\n\r\nI have a \"band\" (more of a project, really) called Schema Factor - If you're into electronic dance music and want to hear/support something a bit different from the mainstream, please check it out on Facebook and the Web.  Looking for similarly minded folks to collaborate with too.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm presently single.  I'd love to hear from geeky girls around the GTA.  Chances are, if you're on the Listserve, we already have lots in common ;-)   Let's go hang out at the Musideum for a concert and then go for drinks, staying up late trying to figure the world out.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll leave you with a few quotes that I've collected over the years.  Be well.\r\n\r\n\u201cA computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing.\u201d - Emo Philips\r\n\r\n\"We all walk around with all this knowledge that we don't share, for fear that everyone else already knows.\" - Jim Butterfield\r\n\r\n\"Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.\" - Bernard Baruch\r\n\r\n\"I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.\" - Stephen Hawking\r\n\r\n\"Even Occam occasionally cut himself shaving.\" - Anonymous\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.\u201d - C.S. Lewis\r\n\r\n\"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.\" - Albert Einstein\r\n\r\n\"Stuff your eyes with wonder, live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories.\" - Ray Bradbury\r\n\r\n\"Millions long for immortality who do not know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.\" - Susan Ertz\r\n\r\n\"You Gain Strength, Courage, And Confidence By Every Experience In Which You Really Stop And Look Fear In The Face. You Must Do The Thing Which You Think You Cannot Do.\" -Eleanor Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\"The story you have to tell is the story you *have* to tell.\" - Alex Eddington\r\n\r\nLeif Bloomquist\r\nthelistserve@leifbloomquist.net\r\nToronto, Canada\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2013, 8, 31]]
