the-listserve-archive
=====================

An archive of posts from [The Listserve](http://thelistserve.com/).

This is the backend code. It uses [Context.io](http://context.io/) to listen for new posts, then commits them to the gh-pages branch.

All code is MIT licensed. If you find it useful, a mention would be cool.
