<p>good morning, I hope all of you are well. I am brahmin from the city of Chennai in India who moved to NYC 9 years ago for school and has been here since. IF you have a minute, you should read about brahmins. </p>
<p>I am not a brahmin in the traditional sense. My girlfriend is an American Jew, I practice mixed martial arts and i don't believe in God. But growing up in a Brahman household blessed with a good work ethic and strong family committment and that's the only thing i have going for me. </p>
<p>I work in a financial start up in NYC. I play a lot of sport (cricket, MMA, squash, tennis, boxing, biking, running). I am a sessions guitar player (with over 19 years experience). But i noticed a few cracks start to appear in my personality. </p>
<p>Over the last few years i have discovered that i have symptoms of the following nacrolepsy, bipolar disorder, and some minor symptoms of personality disorder (narcissistic). I also have gambling problems.   Any help  regd the above, tips / experiences would be great. It has had an impact on my social life and i am looking to work on them. </p>
<p><br />Good luck,</p>
